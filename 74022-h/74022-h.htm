<small>SALLY’S GARDEN PARTY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time, and not so long ago, there
lived a little girl named Sally Waters.</p>

<p>She was a merry, laughing little girl, with a
lively twinkle in her bright blue eyes, a neat
pair of dimples—one in each red cheek—and
the sauciest little nose that has ever been
seen.</p>

<p>Indeed, sometimes her father called her
‘Saucy Sally.’ But that was only his way of
saying that he loved her better than any one
else in the world, except, of course, Sally’s
mother.</p>

<p>One bright summer morning Sally sat out on
her doorstep in the sun. At her feet, half asleep,
lay Buff, Sally’s plump, yellow pussy-cat. Beside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
her sat Tippy, her little brown dog, his ears
cocked, his nose in the air.</p>

<p>But this morning Sally was not smiling. She
looked so sober that Tippy watched her carefully
with his shining brown eyes. She looked so
very sober that Tippy was almost afraid that
Sally was going to cry.</p>

<p>What ailed little Sally Waters, who was usually
so merry and full of fun?</p>

<p>The truth is, Sally felt lonely. Not five minutes
ago she had waved good-bye to Father and
Mother as they started off for a day in the city.
And as Sally remembered what a long, long day
this was sure to be before she saw Father and
Mother again, it really did seem as if Sally were
going to cry.</p>

<p>She quite forgot that she was to spend the
day with Aunt Bee just next door. She quite
forgot that Father had promised to bring her a
present from the city. She quite forgot that she
had whispered to Mother, with her very last hug,
that she would be as good as gold all day long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>All Sally remembered was that Father and
Mother had left her. And a big round tear had
squeezed itself from the corner of each eye and
was actually rolling down her cheek when Tippy
sprang up in the air with such a sudden, such
a comical sneeze that Sally laughed out loud.
Buff opened his sleepy eyes with a look of
surprise that made Sally laugh again, while
Tippy, seeing Sally’s smiling face, jumped up
and down on the doorstep, barking merrily the
while.</p>

<p>After her laugh Sally felt better, much better.</p>

<p>‘We must go straight to Aunt Bee’s, Tippy,’
said she, drying her cheeks with the hem of her
frock. ‘She will be watching for you and me, I
expect. Good-bye, Buff. Take good care of the
house, unless you would like to come with us,
too,’ she added politely.</p>

<p>Sally knew that Buff usually chose to stay at
home alone. So she was not at all surprised to
see her pussy settle himself in a sunny spot and
prepare to take a comfortable morning nap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>‘Good-bye, Buff,’ said she again. ‘Be a good
pussy.’</p>

<p>And with a farewell pat, she and Tippy were
off.</p>

<p>Sally might have gone to Aunt Bee’s through
the garden and over the hedge. But instead she
and Tippy walked down her front path and up
Aunt Bee’s just as if she were real company
come to spend the day.</p>

<p>As Sally had said, there was Aunt Bee waiting
for them in the doorway.</p>

<p>‘Come in, Sally,’ she began briskly, ‘and
help me make a cake. Tippy may stay out in
the garden and chase the butterflies.’</p>

<p>‘Will you really let me help?’ asked Sally,
smiling at the very thought and holding fast to
Aunt Bee’s hand on their way out to the kitchen.
‘What can I do to help, Aunt Bee?’</p>

<p>‘You can beat eggs, and butter pans, and
watch,’ was Aunt Bee’s answer, as she fastened
an apron on Sally that reached from her neck to
her heels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>So first of all, Sally buttered pans with might
and main. Then she spun Aunt Bee’s little egg-beater
round and round and round until her
bowl of eggs was as white and frothy as cream.</p>

<p>‘Better than I could do it myself, Sally,’ said
Aunt Bee with a smile.</p>

<p>Last of all she watched Aunt Bee mix the
batter, and pour it into the pans, and shut it
in the oven. She watched her make the icing,
chocolate icing, too.</p>

<p>Then Sally stopped watching because she
was scraping, scraping the bowls and eating
what she scraped. She ate a whole spoonful
of cake batter and more than a spoonful of
icing.</p>

<p>‘You have scraped the bowls so clean I am
afraid you won’t be able to eat your luncheon,’
said Aunt Bee.</p>

<p>But that was not true. Sally did eat her
luncheon, running out to the pantry only twice
to see whether the icing on the cake had grown
quite hard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>For the cake was to be used at a party later
that afternoon.</p>

<p>‘We will carry a little table out into the garden,
Sally, under the black-cherry tree,’ said
Aunt Bee. ‘You would like that better than going
down to the rocks this afternoon, wouldn’t you?’</p>

<p>Sally, you must know, lived by the sea, and
almost every day went down to play on the
rocky shore. A garden party would be much
more of a treat, and Sally said so, with her arms
about Aunt Bee’s neck in a tight, tight squeeze.</p>

<p>‘I thought you would like a party,’ said wise
Aunt Bee. ‘You shall set the table with the
dishes I had when I was a little girl, and then
you and I will sit down like ladies at tea and
have the party.’</p>

<p>Sally pressed her hands together hard and
smiled all over her round little face.</p>

<p>‘This is the very nicest time I have had since—since
Christmas,’ said Sally with a gay little
hop. ‘I think you are just as good as Santa
Claus, Aunt Bee.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>Then Sally had a thought.</p>

<p>‘Won’t Tippy have any of the party?’ asked
Sally.</p>

<p>‘Tippy? He shall have a bone,’ was Aunt
Bee’s answer. ‘That is the kind of a party he
will like, you know.’</p>

<p>So Sally went into the garden to tell Tippy
all about the party. And as Tippy was still
chasing butterflies, Sally in turn chased Tippy
round and round, in and out the garden beds,
until at last she and Tippy could run no more
and sat themselves down on the doorstep to
cool off and rest.</p>

<p>Now the street upon which both Sally and
Aunt Bee lived was a narrow street, a narrow,
crooked little street that ran downhill to the sea
with many a twist and turn. And across the
way from Aunt Bee and Sally there stood a little
house on the slope of the hill in which lived
their friend Miss Neppy Lee.</p>

<p>Miss Neppy was a little old lady who lived
all alone, with not even a cat or a dog to keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
her company. But early every summer Miss
Neppy put a sign in her front window, a card
that read ‘Rooms,’ and every summer Miss
Neppy had a paying guest or two who stayed
until the flowers had gone and the wind grew
cold and autumn and winter were close at hand.</p>

<p>Sally was always interested in Miss Neppy’s
‘Roomers,’ as they were called. Very often the
‘Roomer’ would be a tall young man or a pretty
young lady who, every day, with paint box and
easel, would go down to the rocks at the end of
Sally’s street to paint pictures of the sea. They
usually nodded and waved their hands at the
little girl over the way who smiled at them from
her doorstep in such friendly fashion. ‘Roomers’
seemed pleasant people to Sally, and she
wished with all her heart that Mother and
Aunt Bee would put signs in their front windows
and take ‘Roomers,’ too.</p>

<p>Now, as Sally sat in Aunt Bee’s doorway, she
glanced over at Miss Neppy’s window, where
last night the sign ‘Rooms’ had gleamed in all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
its black and white. And in a twinkling, Sally
saw that the sign ‘Rooms’ was gone. Even
more, as she looked, she saw Miss Neppy’s
front door open and a little girl slip out and
seat herself on the doorstone.</p>

<p>She was a small girl, not quite so tall as
Sally. Her eyes were brown, a gentle brown,
while Sally’s were bright and blue. Her brown
hair curled softly about her face, not at all like
Sally’s yellow mop that had to be brushed and
brushed before it would even think of lying
down.</p>

<p>The little girl looked over at Sally and Sally
looked over at the little girl. Then Sally smiled
and the little girl smiled back. Next Sally
waved her hand, and after waiting a moment as
if to make sure that Sally meant her, the little
girl waved her hand, too.</p>

<p>Aunt Bee came round the corner of the house
and Sally sprang off the doorstep to meet
her.</p>

<p>‘Aunt Bee,’ whispered Sally in a loud voice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
‘look over there. See that little girl on Miss
Neppy’s doorstep!’</p>

<p>Aunt Bee looked over at the strange little
girl who was watching every motion Sally
made.</p>

<p>‘She must have come to Miss Neppy’s last
night or this morning,’ said Aunt Bee. ‘She
looks as if she were about your age, Sally.’</p>

<p>Sally was silent for a moment. Then she
caught her aunt’s hand in a sudden squeeze.</p>

<p>‘Aunt Bee, oh, Aunt Bee!’ exclaimed Sally.
‘<i>Do</i> you think that little girl could come to our
party?’</p>

<p>‘Why, I think so,’ said Aunt Bee, laughing at
Sally’s eager face. ‘I will go over and speak to
Miss Neppy about it.’</p>

<p>So over the way stepped kind Aunt Bee, and
back she came, in a moment or two, leading the
strange little girl by the hand.</p>

<p>‘Sally, this is Alice, Alice Burr,’ said Aunt
Bee, ‘and she has come with her mother to
spend the summer here at Miss Neppy’s house.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
Now if you little girls will set the table, I will
bring out the refreshments for our party.’</p>

<p>The two little girls soon made friends as they
spread the cloth over the low table set in the
cool shade of the black-cherry tree.</p>

<p>‘Don’t you think my Aunt Bee’s dishes are
beautiful?’ asked Sally, setting out cups and
saucers in a series of gentle thumps.</p>

<p>Alice was putting round the plates, but she
stopped to admire the gay pink-and-white
china with her head tilted on one side.</p>

<p>‘It is the prettiest set I have ever seen,’ said she
earnestly. ‘I always like pink flowers best of all.’</p>

<p>‘Now Tippy must have his bone,’ said Sally,
when the table was set and they were ready to
sit down. ‘And I think I will run home for Buff
and bring him over to have a saucer of milk. It
is too bad he should miss the party just because
he is not very sociable.’</p>

<p>So Buff was coaxed through the hedge to join
the party, and Tippy was placed the other side
of the tree to gnaw his bone. The cake was cut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
and passed about. Milk was poured from a tall
amber pitcher into the delicate pink-and-white
cups. And Sally and Alice and Aunt Bee smiled
at one another as they said over and over again
what a pleasant party they were having under
the black-cherry tree.</p>

<p>‘It won’t take us a moment to clear away,’
said Aunt Bee, when the pitcher was empty and
the cake half gone. ‘I think, Sally, that you and
Alice will have time to play in the garden.’</p>

<p>And so they did.</p>

<p>First Sally showed Alice all about Aunt Bee’s
garden, and then they squeezed through the
hedge into Sally’s yard.</p>

<p>‘Here is the robin’s nest up in the maple
tree,’ cried Sally, pointing up among the leafy
green boughs. ‘Can you see, Alice? Can you
see the birds in the nest? And here on the edge
of the path is the hole where the old toad lives.
He comes out for a walk every night when the
sun goes down. And here is my swing, Alice.
Do you like to swing?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>Yes, Alice liked to swing.</p>

<p>And it was while they were playing happily
together that Sally heard Aunt Bee’s voice
calling,</p>

<p>‘Sally! Sally! Here come Mother and Father
up the street!’</p>

<p>Sally could scarcely believe it. It seemed
such a short time ago that she had watched
them out of sight on their way to the city. How
quickly the long, long day had passed!</p>

<p>‘I was good, Mother,’ called Sally, dancing up
and down and then running forward to fling her
arms about Mother’s neck. ‘I was as good as
gold. Did you bring me a present, Father? The
present you promised you would?’</p>

<p>Of course Father had brought Sally her
present, a pretty, white wooden dove, whose
wings flapped merrily to and fro in the wind.</p>

<p>Father fastened him outside the window in
Sally’s room where the breeze from the sea blew
all day long.</p>

<p>When bedtime came Sally went to the window<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
for a last peep at her little white dove, and
there across the way in Miss Neppy’s window
stood Alice, in her nightgown, too, ready like
Sally to creep into her little white bed.</p>

<p>‘Good-night, Alice,’ called Sally across the
narrow street. ‘Come and play with me to-morrow,
with my bird and dolls and everything.’</p>

<p>‘Mother,’ said Sally solemnly, as she turned
away from the window, ‘I don’t know what I
would do if Alice hadn’t come to stay at Miss
Neppy’s this summer.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>WHAT HAPPENED TO TILLY MAUD</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first thing Sally heard the next morning
when she opened her eyes was a splash and a
drip, a drip and a splash.</p>

<p>‘It is raining,’ said Sally. ‘My new little dove
will be drowned.’</p>

<p>But when Sally ran to the window, her little
white dove didn’t seem to be minding the rain
in the least. His coat glistened in the wet like
silver, his black eyes looked blacker, his yellow
bill more yellow, while his wings whirled
briskly about in the damp wind as if the gay
little fellow were really enjoying the rainy day.</p>

<p>‘I believe he likes the rain, Mother,’ said
Sally, ‘and so do I, if I may have Alice over to
play with me.’</p>

<p>Sally’s playroom was up in the attic. At one
end were trunks and boxes and bundles. These
belonged to Mother and were not to be touched.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
But the other end was Sally’s own, and here
were gathered all her toys and treasures, large
and small.</p>

<p>So up the steep attic stairs this rainy morning
climbed Sally, followed by Alice from over the
way, who held under one arm a gay picture
book and under the other a plump, if somewhat
dingy, rag doll.</p>

<p>‘I thought I would bring my picture book,’
Said Alice, out of breath at the top of the stairs,
‘and my dolly, too. Her name is Tilly Maud.
But let me see your toys first.’</p>

<p>Sally was only too glad to walk about her end
of the attic, pointing out her toys and telling
the name and history of each one.</p>

<p>‘Here is my rocking horse,’ said she, patting a
shabby gray pony, who had lost most of his tail,
but whose eyes still glistened brown and bright.
‘His name is Dapple Gray. And here are three
of my children. They live in this shoe-box.
Their names are Dora and Nora and Flora, and
no one can tell them apart but me.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>Dora and Nora and Flora were three little
black-haired dolls with china heads and sawdust
bodies. One was dressed in pink, and one in
blue, and one in green. They sat in a stiff row
and smiled sweetly up at Sally and Alice with
their tiny red mouths. They all had shining,
black eyes and round, red cheeks and black
boots painted on their china feet.</p>

<p>‘They look just alike to me,’ said Alice. ‘I
don’t see how you ever know them apart.’</p>

<p>‘I will tell you,’ answered Sally, ‘only remember
it is a secret.’</p>

<p>She leaned forward and spoke softly in Alice’s
ear.</p>

<p>‘I know them by their clothes,’ whispered
Sally. ‘Dora wears pink, and Nora wears blue,
and Flora wears green. Isn’t that easy? Now
come and see my other dolls. They are asleep
in the cradle.’</p>

<p>Sally led the way to a low, old-fashioned
wooden cradle, quite large enough to hold a real
baby or two, and with a push set it swinging
sleepily to and fro.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>‘It is a really-truly cradle,’ explained Sally
with a nod of her head. ‘It was mine, and it
was Mother’s, and it was Grandmother’s, too.
But I use it for my dolls because we have no
baby who needs it now.’</p>

<p>‘We have no baby, either,’ volunteered
Alice, ‘only Mother and me.’</p>

<p>‘This is Nancy Lee,’ went on Sally, lifting
from the cradle a doll dressed in a white middy
blouse and dark blue bloomers. ‘She is made of
wood. Captain Ball down the street made her.
He has a little shop. See, she can bend her arms
and legs, and she will never, never break.’</p>

<p>Nancy Lee was a sturdy, strong little doll
made of wood from head to foot, with eyes of
ocean blue and a neat row of yellow curls. Her
back was as stiff as a poker, quite different from
the floppy rag doll whom Sally now lifted from
her bed.</p>

<p>‘Here is Paulina,’ said Sally, trying to
straighten the dolly’s drooping head. ‘She is as
old as I am, and almost as worn-out looking as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
your Tilly Maud. But I love her even if she is
dirty and old.’</p>

<p>‘They are the best to sleep with,’ said Alice
soberly. ‘I have a white bed for my dolls at
home. But all my toys are packed away, and I
have only Tilly Maud with me here.’</p>

<p>‘This is my stove, and here is my doll-house,’
went on Sally, moving round the room. ‘Father
made the house for me out of a big box last winter.
And this sofa has a broken leg. It can’t
stay downstairs. So sometimes I play it is a
ship, and sometimes a train. It is anything
I like. Now what shall we play this morning,
Alice? You tell first what you want to
play.’</p>

<p>‘I would like to play “house,”’ said Alice
promptly. ‘I like “house” best of all. Tilly
Maud is sick. She ought to go to bed.’</p>

<p>‘So is Paulina,’ returned Sally, well pleased
with this idea. ‘See how red her face is! She
has measles, I think. And Dora and Nora and
Flora ought to go to bed, too. Don’t you think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
their faces are too red, Alice, to stay up any
longer?’</p>

<p>It was quite true that the cheeks of Dora and
Nora and Flora were as red as the reddest cherries
that ever grew on a tree, and Sally and
Alice were of one mind in thinking that these
dollies must be very ill indeed.</p>

<p>‘Let us put every one of them to bed together
on the sofa,’ suggested Alice.</p>

<p>So all in a row the sick and suffering children
were placed on the old sofa and tenderly covered
from the chill of the rainy day.</p>

<p>On the end lay Tilly Maud, and next to her
came Paulina, both of them long and limp and
shabby, with toes that would stick out from
under the coverlet no matter how often their
nurses patted them down or tucked them
snugly in.</p>

<p>‘We will put Nancy Lee to bed, too,’ decided
Sally, ‘because she is sure to catch measles
from the other children, even if she hasn’t them
now.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>So Nancy Lee, stiff and stubby, was snuggled
down beside her sister Paulina.</p>

<p>Then came the rosy Dora and Nora and
Flora, still smiling sweetly in spite of being put
to bed in high black boots and the only dresses
they owned in all the world.</p>

<p>‘Now they must have medicine,’ said Sally
with spirit. ‘Here are spoons. But we haven’t
any bottles. What shall we do?’</p>

<p>‘One can take a cup,’ answered Alice, who
had been examining the stove and the little tin
cupboard above it, ‘and the other can use this
little pail.’</p>

<p>So up and down the row of sufferers went
Sally and Alice, armed with their spoons and
pail and cup.</p>

<p>‘They must have medicine every two minutes
by the clock,’ said Sally, taking from the
doll-house the little grandfather clock and setting
the tiny pendulum a-swing.</p>

<p>‘It is very thick and black medicine,’ said
Alice, stirring round and round in her empty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
pail. ‘I think thick and black medicine is the
best, don’t you?’</p>

<p>‘Always,’ was Sally’s answer, as she lifted
poor Paulina to take her tenth dose.</p>

<p>‘See how nicely Tilly Maud drinks her medicine!
She doesn’t even make a face,’ said Alice,
smiling proudly down on helpless Tilly Maud,
who looked as miserable as a dolly could.</p>

<p>‘Paulina is not so good, I am afraid,’ said
Sally, with a frown and a severe wave of her
spoon. ‘She doesn’t want to open her mouth
for me. Perhaps I shall have to hold her nose,
next time.’</p>

<p>‘How can you,’ asked Alice, ‘when she hasn’t
any nose?’</p>

<p>‘S-s-sh-sh!’ said Sally. ‘I only said that to
make her behave. I don’t think these children
are getting well fast enough, Alice. You ride
Dapple Gray for the doctor, and I will go downstairs
for Tippy to come up and be the doctor
for us.’</p>

<p>So Alice climbed on Dapple Gray and away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
she rode at a great pace to fetch the doctor,
while Sally sped downstairs in search of Master
Tip.</p>

<p>Presently back came Sally dragging with her
sleepy Buff.</p>

<p>‘I couldn’t bring Tippy,’ she explained,
‘because he has been out all morning in the wet
and Mother wouldn’t let him come in the house
with his muddy feet. He wanted to come. He
is jumping and barking at the back door now.
But Buff will have to do instead.’</p>

<p>So Buff was marched up and down the sofa
and made to look each sufferer in the face.
But before he had time to say whether he
thought his patients better or worse, there came
a loud scratching of feet, a rush up the attic
stairs, and across the room whirled Tippy, wet
and muddy, to land with a thump on the sofa
on top of the whole family of dolls.</p>

<p>‘Mi-e-ow!’ cried Dr. Buff in a fright, and
took refuge on the window-sill.</p>

<p>‘Come down, Tip, come down,’ called Sally,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
stamping her foot; while Alice pressed her hands
together in distress as she saw the pretty coverlet
and the row of clean dollies spattered and
spotted from one end to the other with mud.</p>

<p>‘Come down, come down!’ cried Sally again.</p>

<p>But Tippy had not finished his morning’s fun.</p>

<p>He did jump down from the sofa. But as he
jumped, he seized in his teeth poor plump Tilly
Maud who lay on the end of the row, and with
the dolly in his mouth, ran round and round the
room.</p>

<p>At this dreadful sight Alice hid her face in
her hands. Sally called and stamped her foot.
But Tippy cared not at all. He thought only of
his fun.</p>

<p>Now he stopped to thump Tilly Maud up and
down on the floor. Now he threw her from him
only to pounce upon her again. He ran to and
fro, round about, with a look on his face ‘just as
if he were laughing’ Sally said afterward, when
she told Father all about it that night.</p>

<p>Then Sally started downstairs to call Mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>When Tippy saw this, he rudely pushed past
Sally on the stairs, and with Tilly Maud still in
his mouth rushed like a whirlwind down through
the house and out of the back door into the wet
grass.</p>

<p>Mother could scarcely believe her eyes when
Tippy, shaking Tilly Maud, flew past her, followed
by Sally, with a very red face, calling
out,</p>

<p>‘Mother! Mother! Stop him! Mother!’</p>

<p>Last of all came Alice, running very fast, her
eyes filled with tears, but not speaking a single
word.</p>

<p>‘Sally, what is it?’ asked Mother, catching
Sally by the arm and bringing her to a stand-still.
‘You mustn’t go outdoors in the wet
grass. What has Tippy in his mouth?’</p>

<p>‘He has Tilly Maud, Alice’s doll,’ gasped
Sally, her eyes big with excitement and her
hair standing out all round her head. ‘Stop
him, Mother, won’t you? He has Alice’s
doll.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>‘She is all I have,’ wailed Alice, finding her
voice. ‘She is all the dolly I have. My other
dolls are packed away at home.’</p>

<p>Out on the back porch they all three hurried,
only to see naughty Tippy racing round and
round in the grass, flinging Tilly Maud up in
the air, dragging her along the ground, and then
running as hard and fast as ever a little brown
dog could run.</p>

<p>Mother stepped inside and back she came
with a broom. Tippy rolled his eye up at the
porch. He saw the broom.</p>

<p>With one great fling he tossed Tilly Maud up
in the air, and then off rushed Tippy and out
of sight before you could say ‘Jack Robinson.’</p>

<p>At a nod from Mother down the steps darted
Sally, but, oh! what a sad dolly it was that she
brought back and laid on the porch at Mother’s
and Alice’s feet.</p>

<p>Dirty, wet, bedraggled, torn!</p>

<p>Tears sprang to Sally’s eyes and tears rolled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
down Alice’s cheeks as they looked at poor,
miserable Tilly Maud lying there.</p>

<p>Even Mother’s face grew sober for a moment.
Then she stooped and tenderly raised
Tilly Maud from the ground.</p>

<p>‘The first thing to do is to dry Tilly Maud,’
said Mother. ‘It may be, when she is dry and
cleaned, that she will be fit to play with again.
And the next thing to do is to put on our hats
and coats and rubbers and go down the street
to Captain Ball’s.’</p>

<p>‘Captain Ball’s? What for?’ asked Sally.</p>

<p>Alice, winking away a tear, listened to what
Mother had to say.</p>

<p>‘To buy a new doll for Alice,’ was Mother’s
answer.</p>

<p>‘A Nancy Lee?’ cried Sally, spinning round
on one toe. ‘Mother, will you buy Alice a
Nancy Lee?’</p>

<p>‘If that is the doll Alice wants,’ said Mother,
with a smile at Alice’s April face.</p>

<p>‘Do you?’ asked Sally, catching her friend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
by the arm. ‘Do you want a Nancy Lee like
mine?’</p>

<p>And Alice, with shining eyes, answered, ‘I
would rather have a Nancy Lee than any other
doll in all the world.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>JOLLY JACK TAR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Captain Ball</span> kept a toy shop, and all he had
for sale were dolls and ships.</p>

<p>He fashioned the toys himself, carved out of
wood by his keen jack-knife and painted to suit
his own fancy, while his sister, Miss Betsy Ball,
made the clothes for the dolls and the sails for
the ships quite as well as any dressmaker or
sailmaker in town.</p>

<p>Captain Ball’s dolls and ships were popular
with the children of Seabury. Almost every
little boy owned a ship. Almost every little girl
owned a doll.</p>

<p>So the Captain was not at all surprised when
Sally and Alice, followed by Mrs. Waters,
stepped into his front room, which was toy
shop and work room in one.</p>

<p>‘Well, Sally,’ said the Captain, laying down
the paint-brush with which he was putting a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
pair of pretty red lips on a doll; ‘well, Sally,
and how have you been this summer?’</p>

<p>‘I have been well,’ answered Sally, shaking
hands with the Captain, ‘but this is Alice, and
she isn’t well at all, because this morning Tippy
ruined her doll. It is the only doll Alice has
with her here, so we have come down to buy a
Nancy Lee for her, just like mine.’</p>

<p>‘Too bad, too bad,’ said the Captain, shaking
his head over naughty Tip, ‘but such accidents
will happen. Now, I have three Nancy Lees this
morning for Alice to choose from, one with brown
hair, one with black hair, and one with yellow
curls. And here is a brand-new little Jack Tar,
finished only yesterday, in case she would like a
boy doll for a change.’</p>

<p>The Captain waved his hand toward a low
shelf where the dollies sat in an orderly row,
and turned to talk to Mrs. Waters, while Alice
and Sally made their choice.</p>

<p>As the Captain had said, there was a Nancy
Lee with brown curls, a Nancy Lee with black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
curls, and a Nancy Lee with golden curls like
the one Sally had at home. Each wore a spotless
white middy blouse with trimmings of blue
and a pair of dark blue bloomers. There was
also one boy doll with a yellow crop of boyish
curls and the same blue eyes with which the
Captain had graced all the Nancy Lees. He
was dressed very much like the girls, except
that a tiny handkerchief peeped from a mannish
pocket in his blouse.</p>

<p>‘Which do you like best?’ whispered Sally.</p>

<p>Alice whispered back, ‘I don’t know.’</p>

<p>But after a pause she said, ‘I think that I like
the boy best, because I never have had a boy
doll. Have you?’</p>

<p>‘No,’ returned Sally, ‘I never have. And,
if we play together, it will be much better if
you have a boy and I have a girl, instead of
having them just exactly alike.’</p>

<p>‘I think his name is pretty, too,’ said Alice
thoughtfully. ‘Jack Tar.’</p>

<p>‘That means a sailor,’ said Sally, who was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
wise in ways of the sea. ‘And Nancy Lee means
a sailor girl, you know. There is a song about
her. Father whistles it.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">‘“See, there she stands</div>
<div class="verse">And waves her hands</div>
<div class="verse">Upon the quay,</div>
<div class="verse">And every day</div>
<div class="verse">When I’m away</div>
<div class="verse">She’ll watch for me,”’</div>
</div></div>

<p>sang Sally. ‘That is the song about Nancy
Lee.’</p>

<p>‘His clothes are just as pretty as Nancy’s,’
said Alice, whose heart was plainly set upon
jolly little Jack Tar. ‘Aren’t they?’</p>

<p>‘Every bit as pretty,’ agreed Sally. ‘And I
will tell you something. If ever you wanted
him to have different clothes, you could just put
them on him and turn him into a girl, and I
don’t believe he would ever know the difference.
Only don’t let him hear us talking about it.’</p>

<p>And Sally put her finger to her lip and looked
the other way for a moment, in case Jack Tar
should have been trying to hear what she said.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_032_facing">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_032_facing.jpg" alt="JACK TAR">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">JACK TAR</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>So Jack Tar was chosen to go home with Alice,
and once the choice was made, the girls felt free
to wander about and look at the Captain’s
ships, of which there were every kind and color
that a little boy would care to own.</p>

<p>There were sail-boats and row-boats, yachts
and schooners, fishing smacks and dories, even
a little warship and a tiny submarine. They
ranged in color from gayest red and blue and
yellow to the sober gray of the small man-o’-war.</p>

<p>Before they were halfway round the room,
Sally and Alice had almost begun to wish that
they were little boys.</p>

<p>‘I could sail a boat as well as a boy,’ said
Sally in a low voice.</p>

<p>‘So could I,’ returned Alice, ‘but I don’t want
to. I would rather play with Jack Tar.’</p>

<p>‘Of course,’ agreed Sally in haste, ‘so would
I. But perhaps some day Father will buy a ship
for me, too.’</p>

<p>The rain had ceased. A watery sun was shining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
and patches of blue sky were showing here
and there.</p>

<p>As they stepped out of the Captain’s shop
they could hear the noise of the sea rushing
up among the rocks at the back of the Captain’s
house. ‘Let us go home along the shore,
Mother,’ begged Sally. ‘Alice came only yesterday
and she hasn’t seen the ocean yet at
all.’</p>

<p>So Mother and Sally and Alice, carrying
Jack Tar, walked home along the rocky shore.
The sea breeze blew their hair about their ears.
The waves thundered up among the rocks and
broke into creamy foam. The boats in the
harbor danced up and down and bobbed about
on the tossing gray water.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, the sun shone out, warm and
golden, and turned the whole world into blue
and white. Blue sky, blue waves, white boats,
and great white clouds!</p>

<p>‘Oh, look, look!’ cried Alice, standing quite
still in pleasure at the beautiful sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>‘When the tide goes out and we can climb
down among the rocks, we find all sorts of things
in the little pools, don’t we, Mother? Seaweed,
and periwinkles, and little crabs, and jellyfish.
Sometimes we go to the beach, and play in the
water and dig in the sand and find shells, pink
and lavender and blue. Oh, I am so glad that
you have come to stay!’</p>

<p>And Sally squeezed Alice’s arm so violently
in her gladness that Jack Tar was only just
saved from a tumble to the street.</p>

<p>Once home, Mother went over the way to
call on Miss Neppy and to meet Alice’s mother,
she said.</p>

<p>So Sally with Nancy Lee, and Alice with Jack
Tar walked up and down and up and down the
street.</p>

<p>Aunt Bee passed by on her way home from
market, and stopped to hear all that had happened
that day.</p>

<p>She learned of Tippy’s wrongdoing, of poor
Tilly Maud’s fate. She admired Jack Tar and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
agreed that he might be turned into a girl at a
moment’s notice, and without the least harm
to his feelings, too.</p>

<p>‘Really the most boyish thing about him is
his hair,’ said Aunt Bee. ‘And if he wore a little
cap or a ribbon I don’t believe Captain Ball
himself could tell whether he were Jack Tar or
Nancy Lee.’</p>

<p>‘But I like him to be a boy,’ said Alice. ‘I like
a boy baby and a boy doll just as well as girls.’</p>

<p>‘And so do I,’ said agreeable Aunt Bee.</p>

<p>Presently the dolls grew sleepy, or so their
mothers said, and down on the doorstep, now
dry in the sun, sat Sally and Alice, to give the
children a nap.</p>

<p>‘There is Buff,’ said Sally in a low voice, ‘up
on the window-sill asleep in the sun.’</p>

<p>‘I wonder where Tippy is,’ inquired Alice,
whose tender heart held no wrath against Tip,
especially now that little Jack Tar lay sleeping
in her lap.</p>

<p>‘I wonder, too,’ said Sally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>‘Tippy! Tippy!’ she called softly.</p>

<p>There was no answer. Tippy did not hear.
So putting Nancy Lee down on the edge of
Alice’s dress, Sally tiptoed off round the corner
of the house.</p>

<p>Alice heard her calling, ‘Tippy! Tippy! Tip!’</p>

<p>But back came Sally, shaking her yellow
head.</p>

<p>‘He isn’t anywhere. He doesn’t answer,’
said she. ‘I wonder what Mother will say when
she comes home.’</p>

<p>What Mother said was that she thought
Tippy was probably taking a nap.</p>

<p>‘Or else he has gone off to play somewhere,’
said she. ‘He knows he was a naughty dog. He
will be back at dinner time. Wait and see.’</p>

<p>But the long day passed and still Tippy did
not come.</p>

<p>Father came home, dinner was over, bedtime
drew near.</p>

<p>‘Do you think he is lost, Father?’ asked
Sally for at least the tenth time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>‘No, I don’t think he is lost,’ answered Father
patiently. ‘I think he will come home
again.’</p>

<p>‘What do you think, Mother?’ asked Sally,
as Mother at last tucked her in bed. ‘I don’t
feel as if I could go to sleep and not know where
Tippy is. Mayn’t I stay up and watch for him,
Mother?’</p>

<p>But at this idea Mother shook her head.</p>

<p>‘Set your little white dove to watch for him,’
suggested she. ‘He can see so far up the street
that he would know the moment Tippy turned
the corner.’</p>

<p>‘I will,’ said Sally, springing out of bed. ‘I
am glad you thought of that, Mother.’</p>

<p>‘Now, Snow White,’ said Sally in the window,
for so she had named her little white bird,
‘you watch for Tippy, and when you see him
you give the loudest Squawk! you can to wake
me up. Will you do that, Snow White? Do you
promise?’</p>

<p>And to her great delight the dove winked his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
shining black eyes and nodded his little white
head.</p>

<p>‘At least I <i>think</i> he did,’ said Sally to Mother,
as she climbed back into bed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>TIPPY GOES VISITING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother</span> was quite right in saying that Tippy
knew he had been a naughty little dog. When
he rolled his eye up at the porch and saw
Mother with the broom in her hand, Tippy
knew that it was time for him to drop Tilly
Maud and to keep out of sight for a while.</p>

<p>So with a jump, and a whirl, and a push
through the hedge Tippy dashed across Aunt
Bee’s garden, round the corner, and up the
narrow, crooked street.</p>

<p>Tippy felt lively this morning, as we already
know. The wind blew his ears back flat against
his head. His glistening little black nose smelled
all kinds of sweet odors—flower gardens, wet
grass, damp sticks and leaves. His shining
brown eyes saw many sights—puddles, and
men, a lady or two, birds catching worms, a
butcher’s boy, with a basket, whistling a tune.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>Though the ground was wet and the sky was
still gray, to Tippy it was the gayest kind of a
morning.</p>

<p>‘I could run and run and run forever,’ said
Tippy to himself.</p>

<p>And that is just what he did do, run and run
and run, until at last, when Tippy stopped to
draw a long breath, he stood in a strange street
where he had never been before. He didn’t know
in the least where he was nor how to get home
to Sally’s house again.</p>

<p>But Tippy didn’t mean to go home for a long,
long while. He meant to stay away until Sally
had forgotten all about Tilly Maud or until he
had forgotten about Tilly Maud himself.</p>

<p>At any rate he meant to stay just where he
was until he found out what was the matter
with the little boy who at this moment flung
open the door of the house before which Tippy
was standing and ran with a scream straight
down the path to the street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>The little boy’s face was red and he flung his
arms about as he ran, and when he reached the
street he turned around and ran right back to
the porch steps again. There he jumped up and
down, screaming all the while, and ran his
fingers through his hair until it stood out all
round about his head.</p>

<p>This was a tantrum, Tippy knew, because
Sally sometimes had them, just like this. She,
too, screamed and jumped up and down and
even ran her fingers through her hair.</p>

<p>‘I shan’t leave here until I find out what this
tantrum is about,’ thought curious little Tip.</p>

<p>And slowly, very slowly, he crept through
the half-open gate and over the grass toward
the wide porch steps.</p>

<p>Now the little boy’s mother had come out to
him, and in the doorway, half hiding behind the
door, there stood a tall, tall man.</p>

<p>‘Andy, stop crying and let me speak to you,’
said the little boy’s mother.</p>

<p>But Andy only screamed the louder and began
to whirl himself round like a top.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>‘Oh, Andy, stop, stop,’ said the little boy’s
mother again. ‘Oh, what shall I do with
you?’</p>

<p>Tippy knew very well what Sally’s mother
would have done, but he wouldn’t have told,
if he could. He didn’t want to see Andy whisked
off to bed, even though it would have cured the
tantrum in a trice.</p>

<p>But just then Andy found his voice.</p>

<p>‘I won’t be sick!’ shouted Andy, still flinging
his arms about. ‘I won’t go to bed! I won’t
take medicine! I won’t! I won’t! I won’t!’</p>

<p>When he heard this, the man behind the door
poked his head out and spoke to Andy’s mother.</p>

<p>‘Tell him he won’t have to go to bed,’ he
called in a loud voice. ‘Tell him that he won’t
have to take medicine, and that he won’t be
sick.’</p>

<p>‘There, Andy, listen to what the Doctor says,’
said Andy’s mother. ‘You won’t have to go to
bed, you won’t have to take medicine, and you
won’t be sick.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>At this good news Andy stood still and
stopped screaming.</p>

<p>In the quiet the Doctor called again, ‘Keep
him away from other children for a few days and
tell him to forget that he has chicken-pox. Tell
him to play with that nice little dog standing
there at his feet.’</p>

<p>Then the Doctor disappeared, and Andy’s
mother followed him into the house.</p>

<p>Andy looked down at Tippy and Tippy looked
up at Andy, and that is how Andy and Tippy
knew one another.</p>

<p>Next, Andy sat down on the steps, and after
Tippy had barked two or three times just to
show that he was friendly, he snuggled up close
to Andy’s side.</p>

<p>‘Good doggie!’ said Andy, patting Tip.
‘Good doggie! Good dog!’</p>

<p>This was very pleasant for Tip to hear.
Sally surely would not call him ‘good doggie’
this morning, if he were at home.</p>

<p>So wagging his tail as hard as ever he could,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
Tip made up his mind that he would pay Andy
a little visit.</p>

<p>‘I won’t stay too long,’ thought Tip to himself,
‘just long enough to make Sally glad to see
me when I do go home.’</p>

<p>Now Tippy meant only to spend the afternoon.
He didn’t have a notion, I am sure, of
staying all night and sleeping out of his little
basket, lined with a shawl, that stood on Sally’s
back porch. If you had told him that it would
be four whole days before he would see Sally’s
friendly, rosy little face again, he would have
been the most surprised little brown dog that
ever wagged a tail.</p>

<p>But this is how it happened. To begin with,
as they sat on the porch steps, Andy told Tippy
why he had had a tantrum. And when Tip knew
all about it, he wagged his tail and looked up
into Andy’s face as if he would say that really
you could scarcely blame Andy after all.</p>

<p>‘We came here to the country yesterday,’
said Andy, gently pulling Tip’s ears, ‘and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
have a pail and shovel, and a bathing-suit, blue-and-white.
I am all ready to play and dig in the
sand. Mother and I were going down to the
beach this morning the very first thing. But
when I woke up I was covered with little red
spots like this.’</p>

<p>Sure enough, there were the red spots, ever
so many of them. Andy eyed them rather
proudly and then went on with his story.</p>

<p>‘So Mother sent for the doctor, and when he
said I had chicken-pox I just couldn’t stand
going to bed now when I want to play. But if
I don’t have to go to bed you and I can have
some fun together, Bounce. I am going to call
you Bounce. Perhaps we can go to the beach.
Let’s go and ask Mother. Here, Bounce! Here,
Bounce!’</p>

<p>And Andy and Tip, who didn’t at all mind
being called Bounce, ran into the house to see
whether they might not go down to the beach.</p>

<p>But though Andy need not go to bed and
might play as much as he wished all day long he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
was not permitted to leave his own front yard.
And as Andy would not allow Tippy out of his
sight, it followed that Tippy was forced to stay
inside the front yard, too. There was a tall,
white fence all about the yard, over which Tippy
could not jump, and at night he slept on the
floor beside Andy’s bed.</p>

<p>He did not forget Sally. Oh, no! But the
days slipped by as he romped and played and
tumbled about with Andy, who would never
have known that he was ill with chicken-pox if
it had not been for the little red spots.</p>

<p>But now the red spots were disappearing
fast, and one morning Andy’s mother, whose
name was Mrs. Thomas, said that Andy might
leave the front yard and go down into the town
with her if he liked.</p>

<p>‘And Bounce? Bounce must come, too.’</p>

<p>So Bounce, or Tippy, was fastened to a string,
and pulling and tugging in a way that made
Andy run far more than he walked, the little
brown dog led the way down into the town. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
as soon as Tippy had walked along a street or
two, he knew where he was and felt at home.
And the farther they walked and the nearer
they drew to Sally’s house, the more at home he
felt. Until, as Andy and his mother and Tip
were walking through a quiet, narrow little
street, Tip began to run and jump and pull at
his string so that Andy could scarcely hold him
back. Then, suddenly, he halted, with a jerk,
before a gray house that stood on the side of
the hill in the midst of a gay flower garden, and
opened his mouth in the loudest, sharpest bark
that Andy had ever heard him give.</p>

<p>‘I have come home,’ is what Tippy’s bark
said, though no one understood him at the time.</p>

<p>And the next moment Tippy was racing
around the house to the back porch and then to
the front of the house again, barking all the
while.</p>

<p>‘It is Tippy! It is Tippy come home! Mother,
here is Tippy come home!’ cried Sally, flinging
open the front door and darting down the steps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
only to bump into Andy, who had run all the way
round the house after Tip, as fast as he could
run.</p>

<p>But Sally was too excited to notice a bump.
She sat flat on the ground and took Tip into
her lap for one great hug. Tilly Maud was completely
forgotten. No one gave her a thought.</p>

<p>Then Sally stood up and looked at Andy, and
Andy looked at her, while Tip jumped about
and barked and rushed at Sally to lick her hands
and then at Andy to lick his hands.</p>

<p>‘I do hope you will be friends,’ was what
Tippy’s face said as he jumped from one to the
other and barked and barked again.</p>

<p>Sally didn’t understand it. She only knew
that Tip had come home. Andy didn’t understand
it. He only saw that the little brown dog,
of whom he was so fond, now found himself
among old friends.</p>

<p>But as Mrs. Waters and Mrs. Thomas talked
together, they understood what had happened
without any trouble at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>Poor Andy! His face grew doleful as his
mother explained that Tip was Sally’s dog. He
winked and blinked and swallowed hard.</p>

<p>But a moment later he was able to say quite
cheerfully, ‘Anyway, my spots are gone and I
am going to the beach this afternoon.’</p>

<p>‘So am I,’ cried Sally, ‘so am I. Mother said
so. Didn’t you, Mother? Bring your pail, Andy,
and we will dig together in the sand.’</p>

<p>‘I will. I will bring my pail and shovel,’
promised Andy.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps Tippy will come with us, too,’
called Sally, as Andy and his mother started
down the path.</p>

<p>And from the back garden, where he was joyfully
digging up an old bone, Tippy answered
for himself.</p>

<p>‘Bow-wow-wow!’ said Tippy.</p>

<small>ANDY AND THE MERMAID</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Tippy</span> did not go to the beach that afternoon,
but Sally and Alice did.</p>

<p>And no sooner were their shoes and stockings
taken off and they were comfortably settled in
a pleasant place to dig, than along came Andy,
with such a happy, smiling face that it made
Sally and Alice smile, too, only to look at
him.</p>

<p>No wonder Andy was happy, for not only did
he carry a gay blue pail and shovel, but in his
arms he bore a sail-boat, a brand-new sail-boat,
fresh from Captain Ball’s shop not half an hour
ago.</p>

<p>‘I am late,’ said Andy, smiling the broadest
kind of a smile. ‘I am late because we went to a
funny little shop to buy my boat. Isn’t she a
beauty? Did you ever see a boat like her before?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>‘She came from Captain Ball’s, didn’t she?’
asked Sally. ‘I know she did.’</p>

<p>While Alice, not waiting for Andy’s nod,
spoke up.</p>

<p>‘My doll, Jack Tar, came from Captain Ball’s,
too.’</p>

<p>‘Isn’t she a beauty?’ asked Andy again.
‘Here is her name, painted on the side, just like
a real boat. “The Mermaid” she is called, and
I know what a mermaid is, too. Mother told
me.’</p>

<p>‘So do I,’ said Sally proudly. ‘They are little
girls and their mothers who live under the
ocean, and they have tails like fish. They swim
and dive and play in the water all day long.’</p>

<p>‘They are very pretty, too,’ added Andy.
‘Mother said so. They wear necklaces of shells
and coral, and they have long hair twined with
seaweed. Their eyes are green like the sea, and
their arms are very white.’</p>

<p>‘Did you ever see a mermaid?’ asked Alice.
‘Do they ever come out of the sea?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>Sally shook her head doubtfully.</p>

<p>‘I never saw one,’ she admitted, ‘but perhaps
Father has. He has seen everything. And
I don’t think mermaids ever come out of the
water, because fish never do, if they can help it,
and mermaids have tails like fish.’</p>

<p>This satisfied Alice, but Andy had a question
to ask.</p>

<p>‘Aren’t there any little boy mermaids like
me?’ asked Andy.</p>

<p>‘There are men,’ said Sally, ‘mermen, you
call them, but nobody seems to think much
about them. Let’s sail your boat, Andy. Have
you a string?’</p>

<p>Indeed, Andy had a string, a long one, tied to
the bow of ‘The Mermaid,’ and presently the
children were running up and down the beach,
the gay little boat sailing bravely along, dipping
and bobbing about in the waves for all the
world like the big boats anchored near by.</p>

<p>‘The Mermaid’ was a bright little red-and-white
sail-boat, with her name standing out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
strongly in green. The Captain liked gay colors,
you see, and so did the little boys who bought his
boats. Andy was sure that he had never seen a
prettier sight than his little sail-boat dancing on
the waves, and he sat alone near the edge of the
water letting ‘The Mermaid’ drift in and out
long after the little girls had gone back to their
sand-digging farther up the beach.</p>

<p>But Andy knew how to dig fully as well as he
knew how to sail a boat. He flourished his blue
shovel and fell to work with a will when he
joined Sally and Alice, who sat cool and comfortable
in the shade of the great lighthouse,
that towered up and up into the air high above
their heads.</p>

<p>They heaped sand piles, they dug deep holes,
they built a fort. They made pies and cakes
and loaves of bread, enough to stock a bake-shop.</p>

<p>‘We ought to have more brown bread,’ said
Alice, who found that by packing her pail with
sand and turning it upside-down she made as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
nice a loaf of bread as could be bought in Boston
town.</p>

<p>‘I will make cakes,’ decided Sally, ‘because
I like to mark them with a shell. When we have
made one more row we will call your mother and
Andy’s mother and my mother to come and
buy. Shall we?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ agreed Alice, beating on the bottom of
her pail and turning out a fresh loaf of brown
bread with pride.</p>

<p>But Andy shook his head.</p>

<p>‘I’m tired of working,’ said Andy. ‘I want to
sail my boat again.’</p>

<p>So off went Andy to launch ‘The Mermaid’
once more, and this time he ran with her far,
far up the beach.</p>

<p>The waves came rolling in, and Andy laughed
and dodged the spray. The white sails of ‘The
Mermaid’ sparkled in the sunlight and the gay
red-and-white hull twinkled in and out among
the tumbling waves. It was all so pleasant.
The sand was smooth and hard. It felt cool to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
Andy’s bare pink toes. He ran faster and faster
and behind him on her string danced ‘The Mermaid.’</p>

<p>Faster, faster, faster ran Andy, and then
suddenly, bump! went his toe against a great
round pebble, out of his hand jerked the string,
and down went Andy on his hands and knees.</p>

<p>He was up in a minute. Of course he didn’t
cry. But, oh! oh! out on the waves sailed the
beautiful ‘Mermaid,’ her long string streaming
behind her in the wind.</p>

<p>‘My boat! My boat!’ shouted Andy, and
started into the water after his ship.</p>

<p>But the waves rolled in so high and so fast
that he ran back on the beach.</p>

<p>‘Come back! Come back!’ he called, dancing
up and down and waving his arms about.
‘Come back, “Mermaid,” come back!’</p>

<p>It seemed for a moment as if ‘The Mermaid’
had heard Andy’s frantic call. A great wave
bore her nearer and nearer the shore. But just
as Andy ran forward, his hand outstretched to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
grasp the string, back rolled the great wave
carrying ‘The Mermaid’ with it out of reach.</p>

<p>Poor Andy! His eyes grew large with dismay
as ‘The Mermaid’ slowly drifted farther and
farther from the shore. She looked so tiny, a
gay little red-and-white dot bobbing about on
the sunny sea.</p>

<p>A lump came into Andy’s throat. He stamped
his foot, but he did not cry.</p>

<p>Farther and farther away floated ‘The Mermaid.’
Now a wave would hide her from sight,
now she would rise, gleaming red-and-white,
only to sink from view again.</p>

<p>‘Good-bye,’ called Andy, the lump in his
throat so big he could scarcely speak. ‘Good-bye,
“Mermaid,” good-bye.’</p>

<p>And, then, I almost think Andy would have
cried if, quite unexpectedly, out of the green
waves, there had not risen a snow-white arm,
that caught the dancing little ship and held it
firmly by the string.</p>

<p>Andy stared and blinked and stared again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>Yes, it was a snow-white arm—he was not
dreaming—and it held ‘The Mermaid’ fast.
And the snow-white arm belonged to some one
dressed in green, who no sooner caught sight of
Andy standing on the beach than, stroke by
stroke, she came swimming slowly toward him.</p>

<p>Where had she come from? Who could she
be?</p>

<p>Then, in a flash, Andy knew.</p>

<p>It was a Mermaid, a kind, thoughtful Mermaid,
rising from her home under the sea to
bring back his little ship to him again.</p>

<p>Nearer swam the Mermaid, stroke by stroke.
Nearer danced the little boat, growing more
beautiful, more red-and-white-and-green with
every wave. And brighter grew Andy’s face
until, when he and the Mermaid were near
enough to look into one another’s eyes, Andy
wore a smile as bright as the glowing sun that
shone above them in the sky.</p>

<p>When the Mermaid saw Andy’s smile, she
smiled, too—a lovely smile, Andy thought—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span> 
waved a white hand to him in greeting.</p>

<p>She was now so near shore that she was halfway
out of the water, and Andy could see that
she was a green Mermaid, just the color a mermaid
should be, of course, with a little green
cap that fitted tightly over her head. Andy
didn’t notice whether or not she wore a string of
shells about her neck, and of course he couldn’t
see her tail because she was in the water up to
her waist.</p>

<p>‘Is this your boat, little boy?’ called the Mermaid.</p>

<p>She had a sweet voice, as soft as the rush of
waves on the shore in the early morning, and
when she shook the water from her eyes it fell
all round about in silver drops as water would
do for no one but a mermaid, Andy felt sure.</p>

<p>‘Yes, it is my boat,’ answered Andy, finding
his voice at last. ‘I fell down and dropped the
string and she floated away.’</p>

<p>‘I thought it was yours,’ said the Mermaid.
‘She is a beautiful boat.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>And with a strong push the Mermaid sent the
little boat sailing toward Andy and up on the
beach at his feet.</p>

<p>She waited until Andy held the boat in his
arms. Then with a farewell smile the Mermaid
turned and swam swiftly away.</p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ called Andy, remembering his
manners, ‘thank you, Mermaid.’</p>

<p>A wave from a white, white hand was his only
answer, and in a moment the little green cap
was lost to Andy’s sight in the moving green
water.</p>

<p>‘She has gone down home to tell the little
mermaids about it,’ thought he. ‘I must go and
tell Mother and Sally and all of them about it,
too.’</p>

<p>Sally and Alice, surrounded by loaves of
Boston brown bread, by pies and cakes, were
slowly putting on their shoes and stockings when
Andy, hot and out of breath, came running
toward them.</p>

<p>‘Oh! Oh!’ gasped Andy, sitting down hard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
upon the sand. ‘I have seen a mermaid. She
saved my boat.’</p>

<p>That was the way Andy began his story.</p>

<p>And when he had finished he said it over
again.</p>

<p>‘I have seen a mermaid, all but her tail,’ said
Andy.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I do wish I could have seen her tail,’ said
he.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>MUD PIES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span> sat out in the back garden making mud
pies.</p>

<p>‘Sand pies are cleanest,’ said Sally, ‘but mud
pies are rich.’</p>

<p>Indeed, they were rich-looking pies that Sally
had spread on a board before her in the sun.
Some of them were ornamented with tiny white
pebbles, some of them were crimped round the
edges like a real crusty pie. But all of them were
as smooth as patting could make them, because
patting was the part of mud-pie making that
Sally liked best of all.</p>

<p>‘I like to mix and I like to stir,’ said Sally,
‘but, oh! I love to pat.’</p>

<p>This morning it looked as if Sally had done a
great deal of patting. Her hands were black and
sticky and her romper was well spattered all up
and down the front.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>But how could Sally help this when she was
stirring up a great bowlful of thick brown mud?</p>

<p>‘I will make a big cake, I think, for Paulina,’
decided Sally. ‘Perhaps it will be a birthday
cake with little sticks for candles.’</p>

<p>So round and round in the battered bowl went
the old tin spoon, and out of Sally’s little blue
watering-can came the water in a lively shower.
Sally stirred and stirred and added more dirt.</p>

<p>‘It is too thin,’ said Cook Sally. ‘It is like
jelly. I shall have to dig more dirt from this
hole.’</p>

<p>But before Sally could even turn round she
heard Mother’s voice calling.</p>

<p>‘Sally! Sally!’</p>

<p>Down went the spoon and up rose Sally. It
was too bad to be interrupted, but when Mother
called there was nothing to do but to go.</p>

<p>‘Well, Cooky!’ said Mother from the back
porch steps. ‘You do look like black Dinah.’</p>

<p>For by this time there were smudges of mud on
Sally’s cheeks and even on the tip of her nose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>‘It is a birthday cake for Paulina,’ explained
Sally. ‘Mother, would you put pebbles on it for
trimming or candles of little sticks?’</p>

<p>‘You won’t have time to make the cake this
morning, Sally,’ said Mother. ‘You know I am
going to have company at luncheon, and you
must be washed and dressed at once.’</p>

<p>Yes, Sally remembered that Mother had told
her of the two friends who were coming from the
city to-day to have luncheon with Mother and
Aunt Bee. Sally herself was to sit at the table
and was to be ‘as quiet as a mouse and as polite
as a lady.’</p>

<p>Those were Mother’s own words, and Sally
meant to do just what Mother said.</p>

<p>‘What dress am I to wear?’ asked Sally, as
scrubbed and brushed, she stood waiting for
Mother to slip her frock over her head.</p>

<p>‘It really doesn’t matter what dress you wear,
answered Mother, stepping into Sally’s closet,
‘so long as you yourself are clean and good.’</p>

<p>‘If it doesn’t matter, then,’ replied Sally, ‘I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
think I should like to wear my new white dress.
I think it is the very prettiest dress I have ever
seen.’</p>

<p>So Mother, laughing, Sally didn’t quite know
why, put on the new white dress, and Sally soon
settled herself on the back steps to wait for the
guests to arrive.</p>

<p>Mother and Aunt Bee were going to the train
to meet them, and Sally was to take care of the
house until they came home again.</p>

<p>‘But I will lock the doors,’ said Mother, ‘so
that you won’t have to think of the house.
Then, if you grow tired of sitting on the steps,
you may go and swing, if you like. But keep
yourself clean, Sally,’ said Mother, in a warning
voice, ‘keep yourself clean.’</p>

<p>‘I will,’ promised Sally earnestly, ‘I will.’</p>

<p>So Mother and Aunt Bee, who, like Sally, was
dressed in a pretty new white frock, rode away
in Aunt Bee’s little car, and for a long time,
perhaps as much as two minutes, Sally sat still
on the steps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>Then she stood up and practiced making a
curtsy.</p>

<p>‘This is the way I will do when the ladies
come,’ said she.</p>

<p>She sat down again and wished that the door
were open, so that she might bring Paulina out
to hold on her lap and talk to her for a while.</p>

<p>‘I could tell her about the birthday cake,’
thought Sally. ‘Oh, I wish I could get in the
house and bring her out.’</p>

<p>Sally stood up and pulled at the screen door.
It was firmly hooked, and the wooden door
behind it was locked, Sally knew.</p>

<p>‘The front door is locked, I am sure,’ said she
to herself. ‘What shall I do? I know. I will
just walk down and look at my pies. I won’t
touch them, not even with my little finger, for
Mother said to keep clean. But it can’t do any
harm to look at the pies, can it? Just to <i>look</i>
at them, you know.’</p>

<p>Oh, Sally, Sally! If only the big brown-and-gold
bumble bee, humming over the roses, could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
have droned, ‘Sally, keep away from those mud
pies.’ If only the birds, flying high in the sky,
could have chirped, ‘Sally, keep away from
those mud pies.’ If only Snow White, Sally’s
little wooden dove, could have warned her away.
But Snow White was fastened to Sally’s window-sill
in the front of the house, so of course he
couldn’t know what Sally was about. And Buff
was asleep on the window-sill, and Tippy was
tied in Aunt Bee’s cellar. There was really no
one to keep Sally away from those mud pies.</p>

<p>So off ran Sally to the end of the garden,
where, baking in the sun, lay her row of
pies.</p>

<p>Sally counted them.</p>

<p>‘There are four big pies,’ counted Sally, ‘and
five little ones, and two crooked little cakes that
I must make over again to-morrow, if I can.’</p>

<p>Next, daintily holding back her white skirts,
Sally stepped over toward her bowl and spoon
and watering-can that were lying where she had
left them when Mother called.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>‘How I would love to stir this jelly round
just once,’ said Sally, looking longingly at the
big bowl of soft, brown mud. ‘But I don’t suppose
I ought.’</p>

<p>Slowly Sally stretched out her hand toward
the spoon, but at that moment a large and
hungry mosquito lighted on the back of Sally’s
neck.</p>

<p>‘Oh!’ cried she, and gave a little jump.</p>

<p>Poor Sally! If she had jumped to the right
or to the left or even backward, nothing would
have happened at all. But instead of that,
Sally jumped forward. She stepped on the
spoon, it turned over under her foot, and down
she went with a splash! right into the bowlful
of soft, brown ‘jelly.’</p>

<p>‘Mother!’ cried Sally in a piteous voice,
‘Mother!’ and struggled to her feet.</p>

<p>Mother was far away, Sally well knew, but
who else was there to save her from this dreadful
plight?</p>

<p>The new white dress was covered with mud,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
wet and soft black mud. Muddy were Sally’s
shoes and stockings, muddy were her knees.</p>

<p>Sally looked at herself in dismay. Then she
began to cry. She put her hands up to her face,
she cried and rubbed, she rubbed and cried.</p>

<p>And when Sally put her hands down, you
could call her nothing but a black-a-moor.
Instead of a pink-and-white little girl, dressed
in a fresh white frock, there stood in Sally’s
back garden a black child, only faintly streaked
with white, who stood first on one foot and then
on the other, because she simply didn’t know
what else to do.</p>

<p>Where could she go? Who would help her?
What would the company think? And what, oh!
what, would Mother say?</p>

<p>At the thought of Mother, Sally fairly danced
up and down.</p>

<p>‘Oh! Oh!’ wailed Sally, remembering how
Mother had told her to be ‘as quiet as a mouse
and as polite as a lady.’ ‘Oh! Oh! Oh!’</p>

<p>How could a wet, uncomfortable black-a-moor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span> 
be ‘as quiet as a mouse and as polite as
a lady’? It simply couldn’t be done.</p>

<p>I really do not know what would have happened
next if, just then, Sally had not heard
some one unlocking the back door.</p>

<p>Then came Mother’s voice calling, ‘Sally!
Sally!’</p>

<p>Sally didn’t stir. She was hidden from the
house by a great forsythia bush, whose branches,
long and slender, trailed upon the ground.</p>

<p>Mother called once more and then went into
the house.</p>

<p>Presently, out came Aunt Bee, in her pretty
white frock, looking for Sally.</p>

<p>She walked down to the swing: no Sally there.
She stood still and looked about her. Sally
made herself as small as ever she could. But did
Aunt Bee catch a glimpse of her behind the
bush?</p>

<p>At any rate, Aunt Bee turned and came
straight toward Sally. And what do you think
Sally did? Down on the ground she went in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
little heap and crawled under the forsythia
bush. There she rolled herself into a ball and
waited.</p>

<p>Nearer came Aunt Bee, nearer and nearer,
until she reached the bush. Sally could feel
her stop and look at the mud pies in a row, at
the overturned bowl, at the great muddy spot
in the grass.</p>

<p>Then Aunt Bee stooped and looked under the
bush. For a long time she didn’t say a word,
and Sally kept her head down and her eyes shut
tight.</p>

<p>At last Sally opened one eye. She stole a
glance at Aunt Bee. Aunt Bee’s face was very
red, and Sally couldn’t tell whether she were
going to laugh or to cry.</p>

<p>Either way it would be dreadful. It would
break Sally’s heart to make Aunt Bee cry, but
she simply couldn’t bear it if Aunt Bee should
laugh at her when she was in such trouble. So
Sally herself began to cry again. It was the only
thing she could think of to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>Then Aunt Bee spoke. She was neither
laughing nor crying, and her voice was very
gentle indeed.</p>

<p>‘Sally, don’t cry,’ she whispered, ‘don’t let
Mother hear you cry. She is going to have such
a nice party to-day. You and I will slip into the
house. We won’t let any one see us. And I will
put clean clothes on you as fast as I can. Come,
Sally, come!’</p>

<p>Aunt Bee held out her hand with such a
sweet, inviting smile that Sally, miserable as she
was, scrambled out from under the bush and
hurried on tiptoe after Aunt Bee into the house.</p>

<p>Up the back stairs they went as quiet as
could be. Mother and her friends, talking busily
together, did not hear them at all. And once
safely upstairs, Aunt Bee’s fingers were so
nimble and Sally stood so still that, in less time
than you might think, she was turned from a
black-a-moor into a pink-and-white little girl
again.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">AFTER THE MUD PIES</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Mother opened her eyes in surprise when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
Sally came walking into the room wearing a
pink frock instead of the new white dress,
but she didn’t ask any questions, not a single
one.</p>

<p>So Sally made her curtsy, as she had planned
to do. And at the luncheon table she was ‘as
quiet as a mouse and as polite as a lady,’ just
as Mother had said.</p>

<p>When the party was over and the guests were
gone, Sally sat on Mother’s lap and told her all
about it.</p>

<p>‘I felt dreadfully to spoil my new white dress,
Mother,’ said Sally, when the story was ended.
‘But I remembered what you said, that it didn’t
matter what dress I wore so long as I was clean
and good.’</p>

<p>‘Do you know who I think was good to-day?’
asked Mother, looking down into Sally’s upturned
face. ‘Some one who was ready for a
party in her new white frock, and yet who
washed and dressed a muddy little girl so that
she might come to the party, too.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>‘Aunt Bee,’ said Sally quickly, ‘Aunt Bee.
She was good. She was the best in the world.’</p>

<p>‘I think so,’ said Mother.</p>

<p>‘And so do I,’ said Sally.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>A PRESENT FOR AUNT BEE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span> was planning a present for Aunt Bee.</p>

<p>‘I want to give Aunt Bee a present because
she is so good,’ said Sally, ‘but I haven’t anything
to give. I could give her my blue handkerchief,
I suppose, only it has washed almost
white. Or perhaps I might give her the little
thimble in my workbox, because I don’t like to
sew very well. Do you think she would like my
thimble for a present, Mother? Tell me what
you think.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t believe your thimble would fit Aunt
Bee’s finger,’ was Mother’s answer.</p>

<p>‘I wish I could sell papers like little boys in
the city,’ said Sally next. ‘Then I would have
pennies, more than I could count. But I can’t
do anything at all, and I do want to give a present
to my Aunt Bee.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>‘Why, yes, you can do something, Sally,’ said
Mother, with a smile. ‘You can sweep. You
know how you like to sweep with your little
broom. Now every day that you sweep the
doorstep clean, I will give you a penny for it.
Don’t you think you could do that?’</p>

<p>‘Will you really give me a penny?’ asked
Sally, hopping about for joy. ‘Will you, Mother?
I will sweep the doorstep as clean as
a pin. I will sweep it this very minute, too.
Only, will it be a new penny?’ asked Sally, who
liked shining gold ones far better than dingy
brown.</p>

<p>‘If I can find a new one in my purse every
day,’ was Mother’s answer.</p>

<p>So Sally ran for her little broom, and never
before had the old doorstep known such a sweeping
as Sally gave it that day.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Mother had a new penny with
which to pay Sally, and the shining little coin
was carefully put away in a small silver box that
stood on Father’s desk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>Evening came and Sally went down to the
corner to watch for Father.</p>

<p>‘It is for a present for Aunt Bee,’ said Sally,
as, walking up the street, she told him all about
earning the penny. ‘But will I grow rich very
fast, do you think, on a penny a day?’</p>

<p>‘Not very fast,’ answered Father, ‘but
couldn’t you do some work for me, besides?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I could,’ said Sally, squeezing Father’s
hand very tight. ‘What can I do, Father?
What can I do for you?’</p>

<p>‘Well,’ said Father thoughtfully, standing
now in the doorway and looking down the
flagged path to the street, ‘it seems to me that
Tony always forgets the weeds among the
flowers along either side of this walk. If you
think you could pull them out, I will give you
ten cents toward Aunt Bee’s present.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Father, Father!’ cried Sally, swinging
joyfully on Father’s hand, ‘shall I begin now?
Shall I get down before dinner and begin to pull
the weeds?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>‘Wait until to-morrow morning,’ suggested
Father.</p>

<p>And as Mother thought so, too, Sally was
forced to wait.</p>

<p>But she was up in the morning early, and
after a brisk sweeping of the doorstep, down
went Sally on her hands and knees to pull out
weeds with all her might and main.</p>

<p>Off and on Sally weeded nearly all morning.
Then she swept the doorstep again and proudly
dropped her third bright penny into the silver
box.</p>

<p>‘I am growing rich fast,’ said Sally.</p>

<p>And so it seemed when she shook the silver
box and the three gold pennies rattled gayly
about inside.</p>

<p>The next day Sally was so busy about other
matters—Alice came to play and Mother had
company in the afternoon—that she was able
to sweep the doorstep only once. But she
finished her weeding, and that night Father
gave her a new ten-cent piece, the brightest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
ever sent out from the Mint, or so, at least,
Father said.</p>

<p>In the evening, Sally placed her money in
a row and counted her riches over and over
again.</p>

<p>‘Ten cents and four cents make fourteen
cents.’</p>

<p>It grew to be almost a chant, Sally said it so
many times.</p>

<p>‘To-morrow morning I will sweep the doorstep
again and earn another penny,’ said she.
‘That will make fifteen cents, and fifteen cents
is enough to buy anybody a present, I think.’</p>

<p>The next morning a final sweeping of the
doorway brought the sum up to fifteen cents.
So Mother and Sally, as happy as could be,
started off for a shopping trip in town.</p>

<p>Going to town was different from going to
the city. A trip to the city meant a ride on the
train, rather a long ride, and a home-coming
so late that after supper you must go straight to
bed. But going to town was only stepping on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
bus and whirling over a country road into town,
all in the space of ten minutes or so.</p>

<p>Mother had a few errands to do, and Sally
liked shopping so well that she did not grow at
all tired of watching Mother select blue-and-white
wool to knit ‘perhaps a scarf or a sweater,’
she was told. Mother bought buttons, too, and
thread, and a new pair of shears, sharp and shiny.</p>

<p>Then her errands were done, and it was time
for Sally to select her present for Aunt Bee.</p>

<p>‘Hadn’t I better go to the Five and Ten
Cent Store?’ whispered Sally, who well knew
how many delightful articles might be purchased
for very little money in a scarlet-and-gold Five
and Ten Cent Store.</p>

<p>Indeed, once inside the store, there were so
many objects that Sally was sure Aunt Bee
would like, that it was really a difficult matter
for her to make her choice.</p>

<p>Mother was patient and allowed Sally to
wander about as long as she wished, and at last
her choice was made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>‘Will Aunt Bee like these, do you think?’
asked Sally, smiling upon her purchases with
pride.</p>

<p>And Mother, carefully looking them over,
answered, ‘Yes, I think she will.’</p>

<p>‘You see,’ explained Sally, ‘I bought this
little duck for five cents because I thought
he would look pretty floating in Aunt Bee’s
white glass flower bowl. He can sail under the
flowers, you know, and in and out of the stems.</p>

<p>‘And this little pink baby is made of soap.
Would you ever think it, Mother? It looks just
like a real baby to me. I thought Uncle Paul
would like to see it smiling at him when he
comes home at night and washes his hands.
He so often wishes that he had a little girl like
me, and a baby is much nicer than a little girl,
I think.’</p>

<p>Yes, Mother agreed with Sally that Uncle
Paul could not fail to like this present.</p>

<p>‘The soap baby cost five cents, and that left
me another five cents,’ went on Sally. ‘So I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
bought this big, thick stick of pink-and-white
peppermint candy, all wrapped up in shiny
paper, too. Aunt Bee likes peppermints. She
almost always can find one for me when I go
over to see her.</p>

<p>‘Are we going straight home now, Mother?
I want to give my presents to Aunt Bee as soon
as ever I can.’</p>

<p>So the moment Sally reached home, she ran
over to Aunt Bee’s with her hands full of
presents. And never was any one more surprised
than Aunt Bee when the parcels were
tumbled into her lap and she was told that they
were all for her.</p>

<p>‘Open them, open them,’ cried Sally, ‘and
tell me which you like the best. I think they are
all pretty, the prettiest presents I ever saw.’</p>

<p>When Aunt Bee untied the string—bright
green string, Sally was glad of that—and took
off the paper, she thought just as Sally did,
that they were the prettiest presents she had
ever seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>‘You must put the duck in the water, Sally,’
said she, leading the way into the house.</p>

<p>So Sally did. And away floated Master Duck
under the pink roses, looking as much at home
as if he had spent all his days in Aunt Bee’s
white glass bowl.</p>

<p>‘Let us go upstairs and stand the soap baby
where Uncle Paul will see him the first thing
to-night,’ said Aunt Bee next. ‘Do you mean
him to wash his hands with the baby, or is he
only to stand and smile at Uncle Paul?’</p>

<p>Sally placed the pink baby on the edge of the
wash-basin where Uncle Paul would be sure to
see him.</p>

<p>‘I think,’ said Sally thoughtfully, ‘that to-morrow
he may wash his hands with the baby,
but that the baby ought only to smile at him
to-night.’</p>

<p>‘I think so, too,’ agreed Aunt Bee. ‘Now
suppose we go down on the porch and break the
peppermint stick and eat it.’</p>

<p>‘Oh,’ said Sally, ‘wouldn’t that be nice?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>So Sally and Aunt Bee sat down to a little
feast which was very refreshing to a person who
had spent the morning shopping in town.</p>

<p>‘Isn’t it good candy?’ said Aunt Bee, passing
it to Sally again.</p>

<p>‘Yes, it is good,’ answered Sally, carefully
choosing a piece not too small. ‘Which one of
your presents do you think you like best, Aunt
Bee?’</p>

<p>‘All of them,’ said Aunt Bee promptly. ‘I like
all three of them best.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t,’ said Sally, ‘I think the peppermint
candy is the best present of all.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>WHAT THE TIDE BROUGHT IN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Father</span> and Sally, Andy and Alice, were spending
a morning down on the rocks.</p>

<p>The tide was out, and the jagged, uneven,
rocky shore lay brown and dry under the hot
summer sun. Soon the tide would turn and roll
in again, dashing up higher and higher over the
rocks until every one would be forced to run
farther inland to escape the wash of the waves
and the dashing spray.</p>

<p>But now the rocks were well out of water,
and over them climbed Sally and Alice and
Andy, hunting for treasures that the sea had
left behind in little pools and hollows everywhere.</p>

<p>‘Here is seaweed,’ called Sally, holding up
the long, wet, brown strands. ‘It is what the
mermaids wear in their hair, Andy, you know.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t think my mermaid wore any,’ answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
Andy, who still liked to tell the story of
how his mermaid, as he called her, had saved his
boat, ‘but then her green cap was very tight
and I couldn’t see her hair. Oh, Sally, Sally,
what is this?’</p>

<p>Andy was dancing about a little pool as he
pointed to something on its edge, as excited as if
he saw another mermaid rising from its clear
and shallow depths.</p>

<p>‘It is a crab,’ said Sally, laughing at Andy’s
puzzled face, ‘a baby crab. See him run.’</p>

<p>And Andy and Sally laughed happily together
as the little crab scuttled hastily away
out of sight.</p>

<p>‘These are periwinkles,’ explained Sally, as
she came upon Alice gingerly poking with a
stick a number of small gray shells. ‘That shell
is a house, and the periwinkle lives inside.
When he goes walking he carries his house
on his back.’</p>

<p>‘Sit very still for a moment,’ said Father, who
had come up behind the little group, ‘and perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
you will see the periwinkles walking away.’</p>

<p>Sure enough, while Sally and Andy and Alice
waited, scarcely winking an eyelash nor drawing
a long breath, the procession moved slowly
off, each periwinkle carrying his little gray
house that did not look unlike the gray houses
of Seabury Town itself.</p>

<p>‘If they were walking in the sand, each one
would leave a little track, wouldn’t he, Father?’
said Sally, blowing upon the slowly moving
houses as if to make their tenants hurry along.</p>

<p>‘I shouldn’t like to live all alone in a house,’
said Andy. ‘I shouldn’t like it at night.’</p>

<p>And Andy shook his head as he thought
of his own little crib standing close beside his
mother’s big bed.</p>

<p>‘Poor little periwinkle,’ said tender-hearted
Alice. ‘Do you think he is ever lonely?’</p>

<p>‘No, indeed,’ answered Father. ‘See him
walking off with his family now. He will tell
every one he meets what an exciting morning
he has had, how one little girl rapped on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
roof of his house with a stick and another one
blew on him until it almost gave him a cold in
his head. Perhaps the periwinkles will give a
party to-night and invite the crabs to come
and hear all about it.’</p>

<p>This made every one laugh, and Sally asked,
‘What will they eat at the party?’</p>

<p>‘Jelly,’ answered Father promptly, ‘made by
the jellyfish, of course.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, show us the jellyfish,’ cried Sally, jumping
about on the rocks until it seemed as if
she must tumble down. ‘Show us the jellyfish,
Father.’</p>

<p>So Father led the way in the search for jellyfish,
and when they were found, lying in pools
of water here and there, it was seen at once that
they had been well named.</p>

<p>‘They do look just like jelly,’ said Alice,
‘raspberry jelly, I think.’</p>

<p>‘But jelly doesn’t have “stingers,”’ objected
Sally, keeping a respectful distance from the
jellyfish’s long, waving ‘arms,’ that would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
‘sting like a bee,’ she told her friends, if they
went too near.</p>

<p>‘Here is a sea anemone,’ said Father, pointing
to a rose-colored, star-shaped form lying in a
pool.</p>

<p>‘It looks like a flower,’ said Alice.</p>

<p>And so it did.</p>

<p>‘Touch it gently,’ said Father to Andy, who
carried a little stick.</p>

<p>Very carefully Andy leaned over the pool,
very gently he touched the anemone, and in an
instant what had looked like a full-blown, brilliant
flower now grew smaller and smaller, until
it was not half its former size.</p>

<p>‘I don’t want to touch it,’ said Alice, her
hands behind her back, ‘but I do want to fish.
Miss Neppy said that if I brought a fish home
she would cook it for my dinner.’</p>

<p>Now Alice and Sally and Andy had come
down to the rocks this morning quite prepared
to catch any number of fish.</p>

<p>Each one had a fishing rod made of a lilac<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
switch out by Father from the white-lilac bush
that grew beside Sally’s kitchen door. And
each one had fastened to the rod a long piece of
string, on the end of which was tied a bent pin.</p>

<p>As they settled themselves in a row and prepared
to fling their lines into the sea, you might
have noticed that behind each fisherman stood
a pail, a gay-colored tin pail used for digging in
the sand, but equally useful for carrying home
a large catch of fish.</p>

<p>‘Did you ever catch anything?’ asked Andy
of Sally, who had lived all her life by the sea.</p>

<p>‘No, I haven’t yet,’ answered Sally truthfully,
‘but then I always think I may.’</p>

<p>‘There are whales in the sea,’ volunteered
Alice. ‘The Bible says so. Oh, how I wish I
could catch a whale and carry it home to surprise
Miss Neppy and Mother!’</p>

<p>‘Whales are too big to carry home,’ instructed
Sally. ‘I have seen pictures of them. Father,
isn’t a whale too big for Alice to carry home?’</p>

<p>But Father was now sitting back in the shade,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
reading his morning paper, and the sound of
Sally’s shrill little voice was carried away by the
breeze.</p>

<p>Near by the blue waves glittered and danced,
while farther out at sea sail-boats scudded before
the wind, little motor boats chugged busily
past, and stately yachts moved slowly along,
dazzling white in the morning sun.</p>

<p>The fishermen fished on with never a bite,
not even a nibble. They drew in their lines,
they bent their pins a-fresh, they tossed out
their lines again with many a whirl and twirl.</p>

<p>‘Do you think we will catch anything to-day?’
asked Andy, whose leg had begun to
have a ‘crick’ in it from sitting still so long.</p>

<p>But just then Alice uttered a cry and pointed
out into the water.</p>

<p>‘Look! Look!’ cried Alice. ‘It is a fish, a fish
out there in the water. It is a whale, I know it
is, a big blue whale.’</p>

<p>Sally and Andy followed Alice’s pointing
finger. There on the surface of the waves they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
could plainly see a number of objects, red and
blue, that seemed to be swimming toward them
at a rapid rate.</p>

<p>‘They look like people’s heads,’ said Sally.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps they are mermaids,’ murmured
Andy.</p>

<p>‘I think that first blue one is a whale,’ insisted
Alice.</p>

<p>Now all the fishermen were so excited that
they dropped their rods and rose to their
feet.</p>

<p>Sally waved her arms and called, ‘Father!
Father!’</p>

<p>Andy and Alice could think of nothing better
to do, so they, too, waved their arms and
shouted, ‘Father! Father!’ as loud as ever they
could.</p>

<p>Father heard. He folded his paper, and came
slowly over the rocks toward the excited little
group.</p>

<p>Yes, Father, too, saw the red and blue objects
bounding along, dancing lightly over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
waves, and, with the children, wondered what
they were.</p>

<p>The tide had turned. Each wave came higher
up on shore, and already an eager bather or two
had waded out into the rising water.</p>

<p>Soon a boy bather, gay in his red bathing-suit,
saw the objects at which three pairs of
hands were pointing and waving wildly. He
paddled toward them, as they bobbed about,
red and blue, and then with a laugh that made
the children laugh, too, he set them bounding
faster than ever over the waves toward the spot
where Alice and Sally and Andy stood.</p>

<p>‘What are they? Oh, what do you think
they are?’ asked Alice over and over again.
‘Do you think they can be whales?’</p>

<p>‘No, I don’t,’ replied Sally, wisely shaking
her head. ‘They don’t look like whales to me.
Why, I know what they are. They are balls!’</p>

<p>‘Balls?’ echoed Andy in a shout. ‘Oh, I love
balls!’</p>

<p>And balls they were, great red and blue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
rubber balls, and what they were doing, sailing
alone over the ocean, was a question hard for
any one to answer.</p>

<p>The merry little boy bather waded back and
caught the balls as they came bounding in to
shore. He handed them up to the children, a
red ball each to Andy and Sally, a big red ball,
hard and full of bounce, you could see, while
Alice wanted the blue ball so badly that she
couldn’t help holding out her hands for it, so of
course the boy gave the blue ball to her.</p>

<p>‘Where did they come from?’ asked Sally and
Andy in a breath.</p>

<p>As for Alice, she didn’t ask any questions.
She was rubbing her blue ball dry on her dress,
with an extra loving little pat every now and
then.</p>

<p>‘I am sure I can’t guess,’ was Father’s answer.
‘Perhaps I shall hear something about it
later on. Play with them at any rate and have
a good time.’</p>

<p>Now you cannot bounce a ball on sharp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
pointed rocks, and Sally and Andy and Alice,
each holding a ball in his arms, were making
ready to scramble back to the mainland to try
their new treasures, when there was a loud
shout from the water that made every one turn
round to see what it could mean.</p>

<p>A small motor boat was chuf-chuf-chuffing
straight toward the point where they stood.
And a man was standing in the bow of the
boat waving his hat in the air and shouting at
the top of his voice,</p>

<p>‘My balls! My balls! They are my balls!
My balls!’</p>

<p>As Sally and Andy and Alice each held a ball,
and even the merry boy bather had an extra
ball in his hand that had just come bouncing
gayly in on the waves, it was plain that the
man was talking to them.</p>

<p>So Father called back—he could do nothing
else—‘If they are your balls, come and get
them.’</p>

<p>When Sally and Andy and Alice heard these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
words, they clutched their balls very tightly as
if they would never let them go.</p>

<p>But now Father was speaking again, for the
man in the boat was quite near.</p>

<p>‘How did your balls get in the water?’ called
Father.</p>

<p>And the man shouted back, ‘The box they
were in fell overboard and the cover came off.
I bought them for my shop over in Rockport,
and I was carrying them home when they fell
overboard. I nearly lost a box of tin horns, too.’</p>

<p>‘If you have a shop, perhaps you will sell
these balls to me,’ suggested Father. ‘Would
you like that ball you have?’ he asked the boy
bather.</p>

<p>But the boy bather shook his head.</p>

<p>‘No, I play baseball,’ said he.</p>

<p>And he tossed the ball he held back into the
man’s boat.</p>

<p>‘I guess I can sell the balls to you,’ agreed the
man, looking more cheerful at once. ‘I am glad
to make a sale anywhere.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>When Sally and Alice and Andy heard this,
they prepared at once to go home.</p>

<p>‘Let us put our balls into our pails,’ said
Sally, ‘and bounce them when we get home.’</p>

<p>So each ball was popped into a pail. They
fitted nicely except that they rose high over the
top, round and plump and gay.</p>

<p>‘My pail is so full I am glad I left my shovel
at home to-day,’ said Sally, admiring the effect
of her new red ball in her bright green pail.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps people will think we are carrying
home fish,’ suggested Andy, swinging his pail so
hard it was well that his ball was a tight fit.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps they will think it is a whale,’ said
Alice hopefully. ‘I would love to surprise Miss
Neppy and my mother with a whale.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps they will,’ said Sally kindly. ‘Anyway,
it is the first time I ever caught anything
when I went fishing, and I am glad it is a ball
and not a fish, aren’t you?’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>THE PERIWINKLE FAMILY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> night Sally couldn’t go to sleep.</p>

<p>She tossed and turned in her little white bed.
She watched Snow White’s wings move lazily
to and fro on the window-sill. She had two
drinks of water. But still she couldn’t go to
sleep.</p>

<p>‘Mother,’ called Sally, ‘Mother, I can’t go to
sleep.’</p>

<p>So Mother came to smooth Sally’s pillow and
to tuck in the bed covers that were sadly tumbled
and twisted about.</p>

<p>‘Shut your eyes,’ said Mother softly, with
a hand on Sally’s forehead, ‘and think of
little white sheep jumping over a wall, one
after another, one after another, until you fall
asleep.’</p>

<p>Sally shut her eyes just as Mother said and
tried to count the little white sheep. But instead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
of jumping nicely over the wall, the little white
sheep ran round and round the field as fast as
ever they could, and this made Sally feel so
wide awake that her blue eyes flew open with a
jerk and she sat straight up in bed.</p>

<p>‘Mother,’ she called again, ‘Mother, I want
a drink of water.’</p>

<p>It was Father, not Mother, who came into
Sally’s room this time, and he must have known
that Sally wanted company more than she
wanted a drink of water. For he lay down beside
Sally on the bed and took her hand in his.</p>

<p>‘Once upon a time,’ began Father, in the
most comfortable kind of a way, ‘there lived a
family of Periwinkles under a rock on the edge
of the sand.’</p>

<p>Now a story was just what Sally had been
wishing for, and at this pleasant beginning she
snuggled down in bed without a word and closed
her eyes, the better to enjoy the tale.</p>

<p>‘There was Mother Periwinkle,’ went on
Father. ‘She stayed at home and kept the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
house. There was Father Periwinkle, too. He
scurried round to find food for the family.’</p>

<p>‘I never saw a periwinkle scurry,’ interrupted
Sally. ‘I thought they could only creep.’</p>

<p>‘You never saw Father Periwinkle out hunting
sand-bugs for dinner,’ was Father’s answer.</p>

<p>‘No, I never did,’ agreed Sally, with the
tiniest kind of a yawn.</p>

<p>‘Then there were the children, Peri and
Winkle,’ continued Father. ‘Peri was a sweet
little girl and Winkle was a good little boy.
That is, he was almost always good. But one
morning he woke up naughty. I don’t know
why, I am sure, but it was so.’</p>

<p>Sally nodded as if she understood. No doubt
she did understand, for sometimes the same
thing happened to her.</p>

<p>‘What did he do naughty?’ she asked with
interest.</p>

<p>‘Everything,’ replied Father, ‘everything he
could think of to do. His mother was hurrying
round, cleaning up the house, because they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
all going to take dinner that day with Grandmother
Periwinkle who lived up the beach. But
Winkle wouldn’t help his mother at all. He might
have dusted or straightened up the rooms.
But he didn’t. Instead, he kept standing in his
mother’s way until twice she nearly tripped
over him and fell. Then when his little sister
Peri was just getting over a crying spell—’</p>

<p>‘What did she cry for?’ interrupted Sally
again.</p>

<p>‘She cried when she was having her face
washed,’ said Father, ‘for she was like some
little girls I know, only instead of saying that
her mother put soap in her eyes, she said salt,
for of course she was washed in salt water from
the sea.’</p>

<p>‘Oh!’ said Sally, hiding her face on Father’s
shoulder, ‘oh!’</p>

<p>‘Well, what do you think Winkle did to her
then?’ asked Father.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know,’ said Sally eagerly, lifting her
head. ‘What did he do?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>‘Why, instead of smiling at Peri and trying to
keep her cheerful and happy as any good little
brother would,’ went on Father, ‘he put his
head in the air and called “Whimper-cat!
Whimper-cat!” and stuck his horns out at her,
which for a periwinkle is just as bad as sticking
his tongue out is for a child.’</p>

<p>‘Oh,’ said Sally, delighted with Winkle’s
naughtiness, ‘oh, I wouldn’t do that, would I?’</p>

<p>‘No, indeed, you wouldn’t,’ replied Father.
‘Well, when Peri stopped crying, and they were
both washed and dressed and their horns nicely
curled, they started off. First Winkle crawled
so fast that he bumped into Peri and knocked
her down. Her shell was all covered with sand,
and right there on the beach she had another
crying spell. You might think, now, he had
done enough mischief. But while his mother
was brushing the sand off Peri with her horns,
he gave his little sister another push that
toppled her over into a pool of water.’</p>

<p>Sally drew a long breath. ‘Wasn’t he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
naughty?’ said she, giving Father’s hand
a little squeeze.</p>

<p>‘He was,’ said Father, ‘and this last push
made Mother Periwinkle very angry.</p>

<p>‘“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,
Winkle,” said she, severely. “You know your
sister sneezed three times last night. Do you
want to give her a cold in her nose? Answer
me that.”’</p>

<p>‘Her nose,’ said Sally laughing. ‘I would
like to see a periwinkle’s nose.’</p>

<p>‘Well, that is what Mother Periwinkle said,’
went on Father. ‘Winkle didn’t answer his
mother at all. Instead, just to be disagreeable,
he began to creep as slowly as he could. He
scarcely seemed to move. He crept so slowly
that Mother Periwinkle was afraid they would
all be late to dinner.</p>

<p>‘“I don’t know what your grandmother will
say if we are late,” said she, looking anxious.
“Do hurry, Winkle. You are as slow as a
snail.”’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>‘Why, periwinkles are snails,’ spoke up
Sally, opening her eyes in surprise.</p>

<p>‘Of course they are,’ answered Father, ‘but
Mother Periwinkle didn’t think of that. Anyway,
Winkle wouldn’t hurry. So, first, Mother
Periwinkle coaxed him.</p>

<p>‘“You are the quickest little Periwinkle I
know. Let me see how fast you can crawl,
Winkle,” said she.</p>

<p>‘But that didn’t make Winkle hurry.</p>

<p>‘Then she scolded him.</p>

<p>‘“Shame on you, Winkle Periwinkle. How
can you be so naughty?”</p>

<p>‘But that didn’t make Winkle hurry.</p>

<p>‘Then Mother Periwinkle thought she would
give him a shaking. But Winkle, in a flash,
drew himself inside his shell where no one could
reach him, not even his mother. So after tapping
on his shell with her horns to let him know
how naughty he was, Mother Periwinkle and
Peri moved along and left Master Winkle sitting
alone on the sand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>‘For a long, long time he sat there, just
thinking of all he had done. He was pleased
that he had found so many naughty things to
do. But presently he began to feel hungry.</p>

<p>‘“I wonder what Grandmother will have for
dinner,” thought he. “Perhaps I had better
go now. Peri will eat everything I like.”</p>

<p>‘Before he had time to start Winkle heard a
Voice behind him, a big, deep Voice that said,</p>

<p>‘“Move on, move on there. Move along at
once.”</p>

<p>‘This made Winkle angry. He was a tempery
little snail, you see. Who could it be, talking to
him in this rude fashion?</p>

<p>‘He moved round, shell and all, of course, to
see who it was, but the big Voice moved round,
too, and kept behind Winkle no matter how
fast he turned.</p>

<p>‘Round and round went Winkle and round
and round went the Voice, still calling out,</p>

<p>‘“Move on, move on there, move on.”</p>

<p>‘Winkle was so angry that he made up his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
mind he would be saucy and stick out his horns,
when suddenly the Voice said something that
made him change his mind.</p>

<p>‘“Periwinkle Pie!” said the Voice. “Periwinkle
Pie! Made of naughty little Periwinkle
boys. How I like Periwinkle Pie!”</p>

<p>‘For a moment Winkle Sat quite still.</p>

<p>‘“Periwinkle Pie?” said he to himself. “We
never have Periwinkle Pie at home. I have
heard of Clam Pie and Lobster Pie and Fish Pie,
but never Periwinkle Pie.”</p>

<p>‘And then came the deep Voice again, “Periwinkle
Pie! Made of naughty little Periwinkle
boys! Periwinkle Pie for dinner!”</p>

<p>‘Winkle didn’t wait to hear any more. He
started off down the beach toward Grandmother
Periwinkle’s as fast as ever he could
creep.</p>

<p>‘He made up his mind that if Grandmother
asked him why he was so late he would tell the
truth and say he was sorry, for he didn’t mean
to be a naughty little Periwinkle boy any more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>‘Periwinkle Pie! Made of naughty little
Periwinkle boys!</p>

<p>‘Ugh! The very idea made him shake inside
his shell.</p>

<p>‘But good Grandmother Periwinkle didn’t
ask any questions.</p>

<p>‘They were eating dessert, seaweed blanc
mange and jelly-roll, when Winkle came in, and
he slipped into his seat and began to eat jelly-roll,
too, without saying a word.</p>

<p>‘“Won’t you have a little Clam Pie, Winkle?”
asked Grandmother politely.</p>

<p>‘Winkle grew quite pale and shook his head.
The very thought of pie made him feel ill.</p>

<p>‘Father Periwinkle was late to dinner, too.
He came in soon after Winkle, and he ate Clam
Pie with relish, two shellfulls, for the Periwinkles
use shells, of course, instead of plates.</p>

<p>‘All the rest of the day Winkle was the very
best little Periwinkle boy along the shore.</p>

<p>‘That night before he went to sleep he told
his mother what had happened to him, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
whenever after that he began to be naughty,
all Mother or Father Periwinkle had to say to
him was “Periwinkle Pie!” to turn him into a
good little Periwinkle boy again.’</p>

<p>‘What was the big Voice?’ asked Sally
sleepily.</p>

<p>Her eyes were closing and opening and closing
again.</p>

<p>‘It was his own father,’ was Father’s reply.
‘Mother Periwinkle met him on the way to
Grandmother’s and told him how badly Winkle
was behaving. So Father Periwinkle crept up
behind him and talked in a deep bass voice that
Winkle didn’t know at all.’</p>

<p>‘His own father,’ murmured Sally, too sleepy
to be surprised. ‘Now tell me—tell me—’</p>

<p>‘I will tell you good-night,’ said Father
softly, as he slipped out of the room.</p>

<p>And Sally didn’t answer, for she was sound
asleep.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>THE PINK-AND-WHITE APRON</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice</span> had a toothache. At least she had had a
toothache, but now the pain was gone, leaving
her with a swollen cheek twice as plump as it
ought to be.</p>

<p>Alice quite enjoyed her too plump face.
When she looked in the mirror she couldn’t help
smiling, her face was so droll. And her smile
was so funny, so twisted, so ‘fat,’ that Alice
just couldn’t help smiling again.</p>

<p>As for Sally, she laughed outright at Alice’s
face when she came over to play that afternoon.</p>

<p>‘This is the way you look,’ said she, plumping
out both cheeks like two red balloons.</p>

<p>In spite of all the laughing and the fun, Alice
didn’t feel yet like playing lively games.</p>

<p>Her mother had gone to the city, shopping,
and Alice, after a little nap, had been sitting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
quietly downstairs with Miss Neppy until Sally
came over to play.</p>

<p>But when Sally did come, Alice didn’t feel
like romping in the garden, nor going down to
the beach, nor even swinging in Sally’s big red
swing. So she and Sally settled down, with a
picture book between them, in the kitchen where
Miss Neppy was ironing aprons.</p>

<p>Sally was always interested in Miss Neppy’s
aprons, and it was because she wore so many of
them. Yes, all at one time, Miss Neppy would
wear as many as four or five aprons, and Sally
knew quite well, by now, what each apron
meant.</p>

<p>First of all, just over her dress, Miss Neppy
wore a small, fine, white apron, trimmed with
lace she had made herself, and often with
pockets ornamented by tiny bows of pale
lavender ribbon. This was her very best
apron, quite nice enough to wear when the
minister came to call.</p>

<p>Over the small white apron Miss Neppy would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
tie a large, full, white one, with three fine tucks
above the hem. This was the apron in which
Miss Neppy would knit or sew or even sit and
talk with her friends.</p>

<p>Above this white apron came a stout one,
perhaps of white with little blue dots or rings,
or perhaps with gay bunches of pink or blue
posies. In this apron Miss Neppy did her dusting,
her bed-making, her shelling of peas and
stringing of beans.</p>

<p>While, last of all, came a dark blue-and-white
gingham apron that covered little Miss
Neppy all round about and was meant for
cooking and washing, for digging in the garden
and for scrubbing the floors.</p>

<p>As I say, Sally had grown to know the proper
use of each apron, and she knew, too, that Miss
Neppy would not feel completely dressed unless
she had the right apron on at the right time.
Sally had often watched her slip out of her
gingham and her dotted aprons when a neighbor
knocked at her door, and once she had seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
Miss Neppy untie three aprons in the twinkling
of an eye and, neat and trim, shake hands with
the minister who had come to call.</p>

<p>This afternoon Miss Neppy was ironing
aprons, and for this work she wore a white
apron covered closely with fine dark blue dots.</p>

<p>Thump, thump went the iron, with an occasional
hiss! when Miss Neppy tested it with a
Wet forefinger to see whether it were hot enough
or no. The pile of ironed aprons grew higher
and higher, and Sally and Alice looked up every
now and then from the picture book to watch it
grow.</p>

<p>‘You must have more than a hundred aprons,
Miss Neppy,’ said Sally, watching Miss Neppy
unroll and shake out a dampened apron covered
over with bright pink flowers.</p>

<p>‘That is the prettiest apron of all,’ thought
Sally to herself.</p>

<p>‘Oh, no, Sally,’ replied Miss Neppy, looking
at the little girl over her spectacles, ‘I have
nothing like a hundred aprons. Why, I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
think it was wicked to have as many as that.’</p>

<p>Presently Miss Neppy finished her ironing.</p>

<p>‘I’m going into the garden to pick beans for
dinner, children,’ said she.</p>

<p>So she tied about her waist a dark blue-and-white
checked apron that covered her all round,
and with her basket on her arm went into the
garden that sloped down the steep hill toward
the sea.</p>

<p>‘I think I will go upstairs and bring down
Jack Tar,’ said Alice. ‘I haven’t seen him
since last night when I went to bed with toothache.’</p>

<p>So Sally was left alone.</p>

<p>She walked round the kitchen that she knew
almost as well as her own, and looked out of the
window at Miss Neppy’s head and back bending
over the green rows of beans. Then she eyed
the high pile of aprons left on the table to air.
On top of the pile lay the pink-and-white apron,
‘the prettiest one of all.’</p>

<p>The next thing Sally knew she had taken the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
pink-and-white apron from the pile, had unfolded
it, and was shaking it out.</p>

<p>Of course she knew she shouldn’t touch Miss
Neppy’s apron. She knew it as well as you or I.
But in spite of this, she first held the apron up
before her, and then, finding that it dragged
upon the floor, she flung it round her shoulders
like a cape, and swept about the room with the
cape flying out behind.</p>

<p>What fun it was! How fine she felt! When
Alice came downstairs she, too, must borrow an
apron and they would play ‘lady come to see.’</p>

<p>Round the room whirled Sally again, laughing
as she went. But, alas! for Sally and her fun!</p>

<p>Somehow the pink-and-white apron caught
on the iron latch of the stairway door, there
was a sharp sound of tearing, and frightened
Sally looked round to see a long strip of the
apron hanging limp and loose from the rest of
the hem.</p>

<p>She had torn Miss Neppy’s apron! What
should she do?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>Sally didn’t stop to think. If she had, she
would have known that the only thing for her to
do would be to go straight to Miss Neppy in the
garden and tell her just what had happened.</p>

<p>But Sally didn’t do this.</p>

<p>She took off the apron in a flash, she rolled it
into a ball, and then she tucked it away in the
lowest drawer of Miss Neppy’s dresser, hidden
under a pile of napkins and the big kitchen
roller towel.</p>

<p>She was just in time, for downstairs came
Alice, smiling and laughing and ready now for
fun.</p>

<p>‘I have been making new faces upstairs, in
front of Mother’s mirror,’ said she. ‘Look, can
you do this?’</p>

<p>But Sally wouldn’t try the new faces, nor
even laugh nor smile.</p>

<p>‘I feel sick,’ said Sally. ‘My throat hurts.
I want to go home.’</p>

<p>So Sally went home. She couldn’t run fast
enough, she wanted so badly to whisper in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
Mother’s ear the dreadful thing she had done.</p>

<p>But Mother had company, two strange ladies,
who stayed until Sally thought they never
meant to go.</p>

<p>And, somehow, when at last she and Mother
were alone, Sally didn’t feel like telling. When
Father came home, Sally didn’t feel like telling
him, either.</p>

<p>She couldn’t eat her dinner. Her throat hurt,
she said. She couldn’t swallow. She couldn’t
speak.</p>

<p>She sat alone on the doorstep with Paulina
in her arms, and was really glad when Mother
called her to come in to bed.</p>

<p>Once in bed, Sally lay and tossed.</p>

<p>Why hadn’t she told Miss Neppy? Miss
Neppy wouldn’t scold. Sally was not afraid of
that. Did Miss Neppy know yet about the
apron? Had she found it, tucked away in the
lowest dresser drawer?</p>

<p>Perhaps Miss Neppy would come straight
over the moment the apron was found. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
might be coming over that very night. Perhaps
she would say that Mother must buy her a new
pink-and-white apron. Did such aprons cost
very much? Sally didn’t know.</p>

<p>Perhaps, too, when Mrs. Burr heard of it, she
would not allow Alice to play with Sally any
more. And would Miss Neppy ever love Sally
after this? If she thought it was wicked to have
one hundred aprons, what would she think of a
little girl who tore one and didn’t tell!</p>

<p>Oh, if Sally had only told Mother and Father!
If only they knew!</p>

<p>Oh, oh, oh!</p>

<p>Sally was crying and choking, when suddenly
she slipped out of bed.</p>

<p>Downstairs she started, tumbling over her
long nightgown, slipping and catching the banisters
at every step.</p>

<p>In astonishment Father looked up from his
paper and Mother from her sewing to see Sally in
the doorway, the tears rolling down her cheeks.</p>

<p>‘I tore Miss Neppy’s apron,’ sobbed Sally.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
‘I tore it and I hid it in the dresser drawer. I
played with her apron, and I tore it and I didn’t
tell.’</p>

<p>And Sally fairly danced up and down, she
felt so miserable and unhappy about it all.</p>

<p>But after a moment or two, with Sally safe on
Father’s lap, and Mother kneeling on the floor,
holding both hands in hers, Sally was able to
stop crying and to tell all that had happened
that afternoon.</p>

<p>When she had quite finished, Father said,
‘Suppose we go straight over to Miss Neppy’s
and tell her now.’</p>

<p>Sally nodded. It was just what she wanted to
do.</p>

<p>So Mother ran for Sally’s slippers and long
blue coat, and Father carried her over the way
to where Miss Neppy sat alone by her front
window, rocking and knitting and humming a
little song.</p>

<p>Miss Neppy, when she heard Sally’s story,
was very much surprised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>‘Land sakes!’ exclaimed Miss Neppy, ‘I
never missed that apron when I put the others
away. And I left it on the top of the pile, too,
because, when I ironed it, I saw that the hem
was ripped. Go get the apron, Sally, and let
us look at it, do.’</p>

<p>Out of the lowest dresser drawer Sally pulled
the apron, all crumpled into a ball. And, would
you believe it, when Sally and Miss Neppy and
Father looked at it, the apron was not torn at
all, the hem was only ripped. It seemed too
good to be true.</p>

<p>‘Mother will mend it,’ said Sally joyfully.
‘She told me to bring it home with me. Mother
will mend it, Miss Neppy.’</p>

<p>And Sally put both arms about Miss Neppy’s
neck and gave her a tight, tight hug.</p>

<p>In the morning, bright and early, Sally
ran over to Miss Neppy’s again, with the
apron nicely mended and freshly ironed in her
arms.</p>

<p>‘Next time I will tell the very first thing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
Miss Neppy,’ said Sally, smiling up into her
friend’s face.</p>

<p>Miss Neppy smiled back.</p>

<p>‘I would,’ said she. ‘Never keep a secret like
that again. And, Sally, there is a peach for you
on the window-sill. Don’t spill it on your dress.’</p>

<small>LITTLE RED RIDINGHOOD’S SISTER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> postman was coming up the street and Sally
stood on the doorstep waiting for him.</p>

<p>His whistle sounded loud and shrill, slowly,
house by house, he drew near, and at last with
a smile and a tap on Sally’s head, he put a
letter into her hands and bade her give it to her
mother before she lost it.</p>

<p>This was an old joke between the postman
and Sally that never failed to make them both
laugh.</p>

<p>‘Just as if I would lose a letter,’ thought
Sally to herself as she went into the house,
‘when I am almost six years old.’</p>

<p>‘Mother,’ she called, climbing the stairs,
‘Mother, here is a letter for you.’</p>

<p>And as Mother dropped her sewing into her
lap, Sally placed the letter squarely in her
mother’s hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>‘There now,’ said she with a triumphant nod,
‘I didn’t lose that letter, did I?’</p>

<p>Mother absently shook her head. She was
reading her letter and smiling as she read.</p>

<p>‘Who wrote it?’ asked Sally, pressing against
Mother’s knee.</p>

<p>‘Aunt Sarah Waters,’ was Mother’s reply.</p>

<p>‘My Aunt Sarah?’ demanded Sally. ‘What
does she say about me, Mother? What does she
say about me?’</p>

<p>‘She is writing about your birthday,’ answered
Mother. ‘She has made a funny mistake.
She thinks that to-morrow is your birthday,
Sally, instead of a whole month away. And
she wants you to buy your own birthday present
this year, because she is in the country, far away
from any shop, and cannot buy it for you herself.’</p>

<p>Sally’s face grew very bright. A present from
Aunt Sarah, and a present that she might choose
her very own self! She leaned forward suddenly
and placed a kiss on Mother’s chin. She was so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
happy she felt that she must do something to
show it.</p>

<p>‘What shall I buy, Mother?’ asked Sally,
her cheeks red with excitement. ‘What shall I
choose? I want a tea-set and a doll’s piano more
than anything else, but I would like a farmyard,
too, with little cows and pigs and ducks like the
new one Alice has, or perhaps a big bag full of
marbles like Andy’s. I could shoot marbles just
as well as Andy. I know I could.’</p>

<p>‘We will think about it,’ answered Mother.
‘There is plenty of time. It is a whole month,
four long weeks, before your birthday, remember.’</p>

<p>‘But, Mother,’ began Sally, in great surprise,
‘but, Mother, I shan’t wait a whole month for
my present, shall I? Won’t we go and buy it
to-morrow? I don’t want to wait, Mother. I
don’t, I don’t.’</p>

<p>Sally’s face was no longer bright. It had
clouded over, and her under lip was thrust out
as if she might be going to cry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>‘Why, Sally,’ answered Mother gently, ‘I
hardly know what to say. To-morrow isn’t your
birthday, you know. If you bought a present
now from Aunt Sarah you wouldn’t have one
when the real birthday came.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I would, Mother,’ urged Sally, winking
hard. ‘I would have the one I would buy to-morrow.
I won’t lose it or break it or let Tippy
play with it. I will be so careful. Aunt Sarah
wants me to buy it to-morrow. She says so in
her letter. You know she does.’</p>

<p>Sally gazed so anxiously up into her mother’s
face that Mother thought for a moment and
then said cheerfully,</p>

<p>‘This is what we will do, Sally. To-night we
will tell Father all about it and whatever he
says we will do. Now run over to Aunt Bee’s
with this card of buttons. She left them here
yesterday. And don’t stay too long, Sally.
Come home soon.’</p>

<p>What would Father say to-night? Was she to
buy her present now or to wait four long, long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
weeks? Sally could think and talk of nothing
else.</p>

<p>‘If I am very good all day long, don’t you
think Father will say, “Buy your present
now?”’ Sally asked Aunt Bee, and Aunt Bee
thought it likely that he would.</p>

<p>Then Sally went over to visit Alice, and she
and Alice talked and talked about the present
that might be bought the very next day.</p>

<p>‘A tea-set,’ said Alice at once. ‘I don’t think
there is anything nicer than a tea-set. And do
try to choose one with pink flowers. Pink
flowers are the prettiest of all.’</p>

<p>Sally did want a tea-set, but, oh! think of a
doll’s piano!</p>

<p>‘A trunk would be nice for the dolls,’ suggested
Sally, ‘only I haven’t many clothes to
put in it, and I would like a rolling-pin and
a wash-tub and some teeny, tiny clothes-pins,
too. I wish it was night, don’t you, Alice?
Don’t you wish Father was home now?’</p>

<p>But, to-night, of all nights in the year, Father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
didn’t come home to dinner at all. He telephoned
Mother that he would not be home until
long past Sally’s bedtime. So Sally was forced
to go to bed without knowing what Father’s
answer would be.</p>

<p>But the next morning she woke to find Mother
standing at her bedside, and before Sally could
ask a single question she knew by Mother’s
smiling face that she was to buy her present now.</p>

<p>‘Yes, we are to go into the city to-day,’ said
Mother, ‘to buy your birthday present.’</p>

<p>At this news Sally was so happy that she could
scarcely speak a word.</p>

<p>She left her chair at breakfast three times to
hug Father close, and, if she could, she would
have hurried Mother off to the train an hour
before it started.</p>

<p>Once on the train there was so much to be
seen from the window that Sally had little time
to talk.</p>

<p>Green meadows, fields of corn, a brook with
cows knee-deep in the shade. Over a bridge,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
through a dark tunnel, with every now and then
a glimpse of the sparkling sea.</p>

<p>On and on thundered the train. Sometimes
it would stop at a small village station to let
an old woman with a basket climb on or off.
Sometimes it roared its way into a smoky town,
the streets lined with brick buildings and filled
with people moving to and fro.</p>

<p>Then came the marshes, covered with pale
green grasses and rushes, with pools of water
that gleamed white in the sun.</p>

<p>Last of all, the city, the great bustling city,
with its dashing automobiles and heavy trucks,
its crowds of people, its haste and confusion and
noise.</p>

<p>Sally held fast to Mother’s hand. If she let go,
even for a moment, Mother might be swallowed
up in the crowd, and then how would Sally
ever find her way home again?</p>

<p>‘Do you think all these people have little
boys and girls like me at home?’ asked Sally,
as she and Mother made their way through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
crowd toward the big shops where you might
buy almost anything in the world.</p>

<p>‘A great many of them have,’ answered
Mother, ‘and some of them have brought their
little boys and girls with them to town.’</p>

<p>Sure enough, directly in front of Sally walked
a little boy wearing a blue sailor suit, and not
far away she spied a little girl with long yellow
curls.</p>

<p>‘I see them,’ said Sally. ‘I wonder whether
they would buy a tea-set or a piano or a farmyard
for a birthday present, if they had an
Aunt Sarah to give them one. Would you stop
and ask them, Mother, if you were me?’</p>

<p>‘No, indeed,’ said Mother. ‘I would rather
go into this shop and look at the toys for
sale.’</p>

<p>In the store entrance Mother paused to let
Sally look in the shop window. It was filled with
stiff figures of women, wearing silk dresses and
fancy hats, and with gay scarfs thrown about
their necks. They all had pretty, smiling faces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
and very pink cheeks and lips. Sally thought
they were beautiful.</p>

<p>‘Are they dressed for a party?’ she asked.</p>

<p>‘They look as if they were,’ answered Mother.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps a birthday party,’ suggested Sally.
‘Oh, Mother, look, look!’</p>

<p>Sally gave Mother’s hand a violent shake, for
from within the store a man was lifting into the
show window the figure of a little girl. She was
dressed in a neat dark blue frock. Upon her
feet were shining brown shoes. Her hands were
outstretched in a most friendly fashion.</p>

<p>But what made Sally’s cheeks grow pink and
her eyes very bright were the cape and hood
worn by the figure of the little girl. It was a
scarlet cape, a gay scarlet cape, and fastened to
it was a round hood that pulled snugly up over
the little girl’s head.</p>

<p>As Sally looked at the cape she thought she
had never seen anything so beautiful in all her
life.</p>

<p>She looked and she looked and she did not say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
a word. She saw how the stiff brown curls of the
little figure were pulled out so prettily from
under the close hood. Just so her own yellow
hair would peep out, if only the cape belonged
to her. She liked the way the cape folded back
and showed the front of the dark blue frock.
It is true that Sally had no dark blue dress at
home, but surely a white one would look just
as well.</p>

<p>Then Mother turned to go and Sally spoke.</p>

<p>‘Mother,’ said Sally, ‘I don’t want a tea-set
and I don’t want a piano. I want a cape for my
birthday present.’</p>

<p>‘A cape?’ said Mother in surprise. ‘Do you
mean a red cape like the one in the window?
Why, you don’t need a cape, Sally. Come upstairs
now, and look at the toys.’</p>

<p>‘I want a cape,’ persisted Sally. ‘Aunt Sarah
said I might choose my present myself.’</p>

<p>‘So you shall,’ answered Mother. ‘But come
and look at the toys first.’</p>

<p>So upstairs went Sally, and round and round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
the toy department she and Mother walked.
Sally had never seen so many toys before in all
her life.</p>

<p>She saw tea-sets and tea-tables, stoves and
pianos. She saw dolls and their carriages, their
cribs, their bureaus, and even their bathtubs.
She saw toy animals and games, doll-houses,
trains, and boats. There were picture books
and painting sets, there were balls and blocks.
There were really no toys made for a little girl’s
pleasure that Sally did not see.</p>

<p>When they had walked all round the room
Mother said, ‘Well, Sally, what will you
choose?’</p>

<p>And Sally’s answer was, ‘Please, I want a
cape.’</p>

<p>So Mother and Sally went downstairs in the
store to buy a cape.</p>

<p>‘Suppose they haven’t one left,’ thought
Sally.</p>

<p>But the saleswoman pulled out a rack hung
with scarlet capes, and in a trice she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
fastened one round Sally’s neck that proved a
perfect fit. The hood was pulled up round her
head and that, too, fitted nicely. Sally noticed,
as she stood before the long mirror, that her
hair peeped out from under the hood just as did
the curls on the little figure in the window downstairs.</p>

<p>‘Will you wear it home or shall we have it put
in a box?’ asked Mother, smiling to see Sally’s
delight.</p>

<p>‘I will wear it, please,’ answered Sally in a
whisper.</p>

<p>She was too happy to speak out loud.</p>

<p>All the long day spent in the city Sally wore
her scarlet cape. She trudged happily along at
Mother’s side, in and out of the shops, up and
down in the great store elevators. She walked
until her shoes felt as heavy as if made of wood.
She was so tired that she slept all the way home
on the train.</p>

</figure>

<p>But when Father met them at the Seabury
Station she was wide awake, and turned proudly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>round and round so that Father might see her
birthday present from every side.</p>

<p>‘Well, I declare,’ said Father at last, ‘you
look just like little Red Ridinghood’s sister.’</p>

<p>‘Do I?’ said Sally, smiling up at Father as
pleased as could be. ‘Do I? But then, who is
the wolf?’</p>

<p>‘Why, Tippy, of course,’ answered Father,
smiling back.</p>

<p>‘Oh, oh!’ said Sally, squeezing Father’s
hand. ‘Will you write and tell Aunt Sarah
about it, about the cape and little Red Ridinghood’s
sister, and the wolf?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I will,’ promised Father. ‘I will write
to her to-night.’</p>

<p>‘But, Father,’ said Sally, after a moment,
‘will you tell her that Tippy is a good wolf, that
he is not bad? Tell her that he is a good wolf
most times.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I will write that, too,’ agreed Father.
‘But what shall I tell her about Red Ridinghood’s
sister? Is she good or bad?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>‘I don’t know,’ said Sally, turning bashful.
‘Mother, what shall Father say about me?’</p>

<p>‘Well,’ answered Mother thoughtfully, ‘I
think little Red Ridinghood’s sister is like her
wolf, Tippy, good most times, too.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>SIX BROWN MICE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was Sally’s birthday and she was six years
old.</p>

<p>Four long weeks ago she and Mother had
gone into the city and had bought Sally’s little
Red Ridinghood cape, a present from Aunt
Sarah Waters.</p>

<p>‘My early birthday present,’ Sally called it,
and wore it every time a cape was needed and
often, too, when it was not.</p>

<p>This birthday morning Sally was out of bed
early. She had been awake a long, long time, as
much as five minutes, perhaps, watching the sun
make a rosy pattern on her wall. But now she
couldn’t wait any longer for the presents that
she felt sure were hidden in Mother’s closet or
dresser drawer.</p>

<p>She stopped long enough to put on her red
cape over her nightgown and then crept into
Mother’s room across the hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>Sally had meant to waken Mother and
Father with a hug, a birthday hug. But there on
Mother’s table were the presents, all spread
out in a row, and Sally simply couldn’t stop to
hug until she had untied the boxes and bundles
that she knew were meant for her.</p>

<p>Father and Mother, too, it seemed, were
awake early like Sally, and were quite as interested
as she in finding out what her presents
might be.</p>

<p>There was a tea-set with pink flowers, the
pinkest kind of pink flowers, too.</p>

<p>‘Alice will like that,’ said Sally in great satisfaction.</p>

<p>There was a wash-tub and scrubbing-board
and teeny, weeny, wooden clothes-pins, and
actually a little clothes-line, so that you wouldn’t
have to use a bit of string.</p>

<p>There was a bag of marbles, every color, red
and blue and green and purple, all striped and
spotted, as gay as you please.</p>

<p>‘I won’t have to play with Andy’s marbles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
any more,’ said Sally, shaking the bag and
enjoying the cheerful rattle, ‘I have my own
marbles now.’</p>

<p>There were two bright picture books, filled
with pictures.</p>

<p>And, oh! best of all, a bathtub just big enough
to hold Nancy Lee, a bathtub that you could
really fill with water and in which you could
really bathe the stout and wooden Nancy
Lee.</p>

<p>‘This is the best birthday I have ever had,’
said Sally, hopping from one end to the other of
Mother’s room.</p>

<p>Even after breakfast Sally couldn’t sit still a
moment. She seemed to be all over the house at
once, and no matter where Mother went, there
was Sally, too, laughing and talking and standing
in the way.</p>

<p>There was to be a birthday party that afternoon
and Mother was as busy as could be.</p>

<p>‘Now, Sally,’ said she at last, ‘you must go
up to the attic and dress your dolls for the party.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
Straighten the attic, too. It ought to be as neat
as a pin.’</p>

<p>Half-way up the attic stairs Sally turned and
came down again. Mother was in the kitchen
and Sally followed her there.</p>

<p>‘My cake!’ said Sally. ‘I forgot it. Who is
going to make my birthday cake, Mother?
Are you?’</p>

<p>‘No,’ answered Mother, who was slicing
bread very thin, ‘Aunt Bee is going to make
your cake.’</p>

<p>‘Then I must go over and help her,’ said Sally.
‘I helped her before, and the cake was good.’</p>

<p>‘No, indeed,’ replied Mother hastily. ‘Aunt
Bee won’t need your help this morning. And
you really must straighten the attic, Sally. I am
ashamed of the way it looks.’</p>

<p>‘I will, then,’ said Sally, starting upstairs.
‘But what are you making, Mother?’</p>

<p>‘Sandwiches,’ replied Mother. ‘Yes, for the
party. Run, Sally, I think I hear Paulina
calling you.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>Sally laughed. She knew that was Mother’s
way of telling her to go.</p>

<p>So, carrying the bathtub, she went up to the
attic and told her children all about her presents
and promised a sight of them before long.</p>

<p>She put Nancy Lee in the bathtub and bathed
her all over, a dry bath this morning because
Sally was in a hurry. She took Dora and Nora
and Flora out of their shoe-box and sat them on
the sofa in a row, just to give them a change of
scene, as it were.</p>

<p>She straightened the doll-house and tidied all
her toys.</p>

<p>Then with two sashes, kindly lent by Paulina,
she went in search of Tippy and Buff.</p>

<p>Buff, as usual, sat on the window-sill in the
sun. He allowed Sally to tie the blue sash round
his neck in a birthday bow. But the moment
she had finished he clawed it off, and when she
tried again, he ran up the black-cherry tree
where Sally couldn’t reach him, and only
blinked his eyes at her when she called him to
come down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>Tippy was more agreeable. He permitted
Sally to fasten a gay red bow on his collar, and
barked and jumped about as if he really liked it.</p>

<p>‘Now, Buff, look at Tip,’ said Sally reproachfully.
‘But you shan’t have the blue
ribbon now, not if you cry for it.’</p>

<p>And Sally went upstairs to tie round Snow
White’s plump neck the blue sash, that streamed
out finely in the wind and gave a holiday look to
the whole house.</p>

<p>Soon it was time for the party, and in came
Andy and Alice, gay and smiling Andy with his
ball and Alice with jolly Jack Tar.</p>

<p>They bounced their balls, they ran races in
the garden. They looked at the new picture
books and played with the marbles and the tea-set.</p>

<p>Then Mother called them, and there stood a
little table, all set for three, with Aunt Bee’s tea-set
that she had when she was a little girl, and
a cake, a birthday cake, right in the middle of
the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>It was a white cake, white as snow, and on it
were not candles—Sally had had candles last
year—but mice, six chocolate mice, with tiny
pointed chocolate ears, white sugar eyes, and,
actually, long pointed chocolate tails. Never
was there such a birthday surprise! Who but
Mother and Aunt Bee would have thought of
such a thing and would have searched the big
city over until the mice were found!</p>

<p>There were sandwiches and milk, all you could
eat and drink, but of course the cake was the
real party. Mother cut it, and on top of Sally’s
piece there sat a mouse, and one on Alice’s and
on Andy’s piece, too.</p>

<p>‘There are three mice left,’ said Sally. ‘One
for Mother, one for Aunt Bee, and one for
Father. But what will Uncle Paul do?’</p>

<p>‘He won’t mind,’ answered Aunt Bee. ‘He
may have half of mine.’</p>

<p>The cake was soon gone, every crumb, but it
seemed a pity to eat the mice.</p>

<p>‘They are so pretty,’ said Alice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>‘I want to show mine to Mother,’ said
Andy.</p>

<p>‘Let us eat the tails and save the mice,’ suggested
Sally.</p>

<p>But the tails were so good that the mice soon
followed them. And then the party went out to
swing until it was time to go home.</p>

<p>It was the end of summer, and the next day
both Alice and Andy were going home. It was
their last play together.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Thomas called for Andy, Mrs.
Burr came from over the way for Alice, and
every one said good-bye over and over again.</p>

<p>Alice and Andy were both coming back next
summer, but Sally’s face was sober as, standing
between Mother and Aunt Bee, she waved
good-bye until Andy was round the corner and
Alice indoors over the way.</p>

<p>‘They are both coming back next year,
Sally,’ said Mother, cheerfully. ‘Remember
that.’</p>

<p>‘But it is a long time to wait,’ answered Sally,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
shaking her head, ‘and I don’t know what I shall
do without them.’</p>

<p>‘You have Mother and Father,’ suggested
Aunt Bee.</p>

<p>‘And you and Uncle Paul,’ answered Sally
quickly, slipping one hand into Aunt Bee’s and
with the other seizing Mother’s hand. ‘I love
Andy and Alice, but I love Mother and Father
and you and Uncle Paul more. Yes, those are
the very ones that I love best,’ said little Sally
Waters.</p>
